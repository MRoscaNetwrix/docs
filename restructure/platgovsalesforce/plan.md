# Platgovsalesforce Documentation Restructure Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the restructuring of the Platgovsalesforce documentation to improve information architecture, reduce redundancy, and enhance user navigation.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Consolidated Getting Started Section**

- Combined all installation and setup files into a streamlined flow
- Merged similar content about initial configuration and validation
- Created a clear onboarding path for new users

### 2. **Logical Feature Grouping**

- **Change Management**: Kept as a core feature but streamlined file names
- **Release Management**: Elevated as a primary section (previously nested under other sections)
- **Org Maintenance**: Combined cleanup, tech debt, and customization management
- **Integrations**: Focused section for third-party integrations

### 3. **Unified Administration**

- Combined settings, scanners, and configuration into one administrative section
- Grouped all platform-level configurations together
- Consolidated access and permission management

### 4. **Streamlined Tools and Utilities**

- Grouped similar tools by function (export, comparison, analysis, cleanup)
- Reduced from 15+ individual tool files to 4 categorized files
- Each category contains related tools for easier discovery

### 5. **Centralized Reporting**

- Created dedicated reporting section
- Organized reports by functional area
- Removed redundant report files

### 6. **Clean Reference Section**

- Moved supporting documentation (FAQ, What's New) to reference
- Separated reference material from operational documentation

## File Consolidation Strategy

### Major Consolidations:

1. **Installation files** (11 files → 4 files): Combined related setup and configuration content
2. **Tech debt files** (9 files → included in 2 files): Merged into org maintenance section
3. **Tools files** (15 files → 4 files): Grouped by function
4. **Reports** (12+ files → 3 files): Organized by category

### Naming Conventions:

- Used kebab-case for all file and directory names
- Removed redundant prefixes (e.g., "tech*debt*" prefix)
- Used clear, action-oriented names

## Benefits:

1. **Improved Navigation**: Users can find information more quickly
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Similar content is consolidated
3. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping of related features
4. **Scalability**: Structure can accommodate future content growth
5. **User-Focused**: Organization follows typical user workflows
