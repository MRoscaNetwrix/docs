# Endpoint Policy Manager Documentation Restructure Plan

## Overview

The current Endpoint Policy Manager documentation structure has significant issues that impact user experience and content discoverability:

- **Deep nesting**: Many topics are buried 4-5 levels deep, making navigation difficult
- **Inconsistent organization**: Related topics are scattered across different sections
- **Unclear categorization**: Some sections mix concepts, procedures, and reference material
- **Poor information architecture**: No clear progression from basic to advanced topics

## Restructuring Goals

1. **Reduce nesting depth** to maximum 3 levels where possible
2. **Group related content** logically by user workflow and feature area
3. **Improve discoverability** through clear, descriptive section names
4. **Create logical learning paths** from getting started to advanced topics
5. **Separate concepts, procedures, and reference** material appropriately
6. **Use consistent naming conventions** (title case, descriptive labels)

## New Information Architecture

### Primary Categories

1. **Getting Started** - Onboarding and basic concepts
2. **Installation and Deployment** - Setup and deployment procedures
3. **Licensing** - License management and configuration
4. **Policy Management** - Core policy creation and management
5. **Application Management** - Application-specific features
6. **Security and Privilege Management** - Security-focused features
7. **Device and Desktop Management** - Device and desktop policies
8. **Cloud and Remote Management** - Cloud and remote work features
9. **Automation and Scripting** - Automation features
10. **Compliance and Reporting** - Compliance and reporting tools
11. **Integrations** - Third-party integrations
12. **Platform Specific** - Platform-specific content (Mac, Windows)
13. **Troubleshooting** - Problem resolution
14. **Archive** - Legacy and deprecated content

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Logical User Journey

- **Getting Started** → **Installation** → **Licensing** → **Core Features** → **Advanced Topics**
- Clear progression from basic to advanced concepts

#### 2. Feature-Based Organization

- Related features grouped together (e.g., all application management in one section)
- Consistent structure within each feature area (overview → getting started → advanced)

#### 3. Reduced Nesting

- Maximum 3 levels of nesting in most cases
- Related topics consolidated into fewer, more comprehensive documents where appropriate

#### 4. Improved Navigation

- Clear section names that describe the content
- Consistent use of index.md files for section overviews
- Better grouping of related subtopics

#### 5. Content Consolidation Strategy

- Files with similar content merged into comprehensive guides
- Overview and getting started content combined where appropriate
- Multiple small files consolidated into logical groupings (limit: 10 files per consolidation)

### Specific Restructuring Decisions

#### Administrative Templates

- **Before**: Deep nesting under applicationsettings/adminstrativetemplates
- **After**: Top-level section under policy-management with clearer organization

#### Application Settings

- **Before**: Scattered across multiple deeply nested directories
- **After**: Consolidated under application-management with logical groupings

#### Cloud Management

- **Before**: Mixed with other features, deep nesting
- **After**: Dedicated section under cloud-and-remote-management

#### Least Privilege Manager

- **Before**: Deeply nested, complex structure
- **After**: Organized under security-and-privilege-management with clear subsections

#### Browser Router

- **Before**: Standalone section with deep nesting
- **After**: Integrated into application-management as browser management

#### Device Management

- **Before**: Small section mixed with other content
- **After**: Expanded section under device-and-desktop-management

### Content Consolidation Examples

1. **Overview Files**: Multiple "overview.md" files merged with their parent index.md files
2. **Getting Started Guides**: Related quickstart guides consolidated into comprehensive getting-started sections
3. **Configuration Topics**: Similar configuration topics merged into comprehensive configuration guides
4. **Troubleshooting**: Scattered troubleshooting content consolidated into dedicated troubleshooting section

### Benefits of New Structure

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can find content faster with clearer navigation
2. **Better Content Flow**: Logical progression from basic to advanced topics
3. **Reduced Maintenance**: Less duplication and better organization reduces maintenance overhead
4. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Related content is grouped together, making it easier to discover
5. **Scalability**: Structure can accommodate future content additions without becoming unwieldy

### Implementation Approach

1. **File Mapping**: Create detailed mappings from old structure to new structure
2. **Content Consolidation**: Merge related files where appropriate (max 10 files per merge)
3. **Link Updates**: Update all internal links to match new structure
4. **Sidebar Generation**: Create new sidebar configuration matching new structure
5. **Testing**: Validate all links and navigation work correctly

This restructuring will significantly improve the user experience while maintaining all existing content and functionality.
