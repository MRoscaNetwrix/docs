# New Files to Create During Implementation

The following files referenced in the new structure do not exist in the current documentation and will need to be created:

1. **`configuration/overview.md`** - Should provide a general overview of the configuration process and guide users to the appropriate platform-specific configuration documents.

2. **`configuration/linux-systems.md`** - Should consolidate Linux-specific configuration information that is currently scattered across agent properties and other sections.

These files should be created by combining and reorganizing content from existing documentation to provide a more cohesive user experience.
