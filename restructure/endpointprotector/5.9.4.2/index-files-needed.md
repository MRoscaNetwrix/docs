# Index Files Needed for New Structure

The following directories will need index.md files created during the restructure:

1. docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4.2/core-features/index.md
2. docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4.2/installation/virtualization-platforms/index.md
3. docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4.2/security-and-access/index.md
4. docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4.2/monitoring-and-reporting/index.md
5. docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4.2/deployment-scenarios/cloud-platforms/index.md
6. docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4.2/reference/index.md

These index files will serve as landing pages for their respective sections and will need to be created with appropriate content that introduces the section and provides navigation guidance to subsections.
