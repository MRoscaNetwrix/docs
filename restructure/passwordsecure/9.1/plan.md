# PasswordSecure 9.1 Documentation Restructure Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the restructuring of the PasswordSecure 9.1 documentation to improve information architecture, reduce complexity, and enhance user experience. The new structure follows Docusaurus best practices and creates a more intuitive navigation hierarchy.

## Key Changes

### 1. Reduced Directory Depth

- **Current**: Up to 8 levels of nesting
- **New**: Maximum 4 levels of nesting
- **Benefit**: Easier navigation and simpler URLs

### 2. Consolidated Single-File Directories

- Merged directories containing only one file into their parent directories
- Combined related files that were unnecessarily split across multiple directories
- **Benefit**: Reduced total number of directories from 184 to ~20

### 3. Improved Content Organization

#### Getting Started Section

- Moved introductory content from deep nested structure to top-level "getting-started" directory
- Combined welcome content with introduction materials
- **Benefit**: New users can quickly find orientation materials

#### Installation Section

- Reorganized by component type (server-manager, client, web-application, browser-extensions)
- Kept requirements together in a dedicated subdirectory
- **Benefit**: Clear installation path for each component

#### Configuration Section

- Split into logical groups: server-manager, authentication, and permissions
- Reduced deep nesting in authentication configuration
- **Benefit**: Administrators can find settings more easily

#### User Guides Section

- Created clear divisions by interface type (desktop-client, browser-extensions, mobile-apps, web-application)
- Consolidated password management features into dedicated section
- Grouped administrative functions together
- **Benefit**: Users can find guides relevant to their interface

#### Security & Maintenance

- Elevated security content from FAQ to top-level section
- Kept maintenance operations together
- **Benefit**: Critical security and maintenance information is more prominent

### 4. Naming Conventions

- Standardized all file and directory names to kebab-case (hyphen-separated)
- Removed underscores and special characters
- Used consistent, descriptive names
- **Benefit**: URLs are cleaner and more SEO-friendly

### 5. Content Consolidation

#### Merged Related Topics

- Combined multiple "configuration" files (configuration_1.md, configuration_2.md) into single comprehensive files
- Merged related permission topics into cohesive sections
- Consolidated scattered user management content
- **Benefit**: Reduced redundancy and improved content cohesion

#### Eliminated Redundant Structure

- Removed unnecessary "passwordsecure" subdirectory under the main directory
- Flattened deeply nested single-purpose directories
- **Benefit**: Simpler navigation paths

### 6. Improved Categorization

#### By User Role

- **Administrators**: Server configuration, user management, permissions
- **End Users**: Password management, applications, browser/mobile usage
- **Developers**: API/SDK documentation

#### By Task

- **Setup**: Installation and initial configuration
- **Daily Use**: Password management, applications
- **Administration**: User management, permissions, maintenance
- **Troubleshooting**: Error codes, connection issues

## Migration Strategy

1. **File Mapping**: Every existing file is mapped to a new location in the restructured hierarchy
2. **Content Merging**: Related files are combined where appropriate
3. **Redirect Setup**: Old URLs will redirect to new locations to prevent broken links
4. **Sidebar Generation**: New sidebar.js file reflects the improved structure

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Users can find content more easily with logical grouping
2. **Better User Experience**: Reduced clicking through deep hierarchies
3. **Cleaner URLs**: Shorter, more readable paths
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Related content is grouped together
5. **Scalability**: Structure can accommodate future content without becoming unwieldy
6. **Mobile-Friendly**: Shallower hierarchy works better on mobile devices

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the proposed structure
2. Execute file migrations according to the mapping
3. Update internal links and references
4. Generate new sidebar.js file
5. Test navigation and search functionality
6. Deploy restructured documentation
