# PasswordSecure 9.2 Documentation Restructure Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the restructuring of the PasswordSecure 9.2 documentation to improve information architecture, reduce complexity, and enhance user experience.

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with essential information and gradually introduce complexity
2. **Task-Oriented Structure**: Organize content around user goals and workflows
3. **Reduced Nesting**: Limit directory depth to improve navigation
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use kebab-case for all directories and files
5. **Logical Grouping**: Combine related topics to reduce the total number of categories

## Major Changes

### 1. Simplified Top-Level Structure

Reduced from a deeply nested structure to 9 main categories:

- **Getting Started**: Introduction and orientation for new users
- **Installation & Setup**: All installation and initial configuration topics
- **Core Features**: Primary functionality (passwords, applications, forms, etc.)
- **Security & Permissions**: All security-related topics consolidated
- **User Interfaces**: UI-specific documentation for each interface type
- **Integrations**: Browser extensions and API/SDK documentation
- **Administration**: Server and system administration tasks
- **Operations**: Day-to-day operational tasks
- **Maintenance**: Updates, migration, and troubleshooting
- **Reference**: FAQs and version history
- **End User Guide**: Simplified guide for end users

### 2. Content Consolidation

#### Merged Categories:

- Combined all authentication methods under "Security & Permissions > Authentication"
- Merged all certificate topics under "Security & Permissions > Certificates"
- Consolidated all user interface documentation by interface type
- Combined all import/export functionality under "Administration"
- Merged all backup-related topics under "Administration > Backup & Recovery"

#### Eliminated Redundancy:

- Removed duplicate organizational structure sections
- Consolidated multiple logbook references into single location
- Merged overlapping notification documentation
- Combined similar password management topics

### 3. Improved Navigation

#### Flattened Structure:

- Reduced maximum nesting depth from 8 levels to 3 levels
- Eliminated single-child directories
- Removed redundant parent folders

#### Logical Flow:

- Ordered categories from basic to advanced
- Grouped related features together
- Separated end-user content from administrative content

### 4. Better File Organization

#### Naming Conventions:

- All directories use kebab-case (e.g., `getting-started`)
- All files use kebab-case with `.md` extension
- Removed underscores and camelCase
- Used descriptive, action-oriented names

#### Content Distribution:

- Each major feature has an overview file
- Related subtopics are in the same directory
- Configuration and setup topics are grouped together

## Benefits

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Users can find information more quickly
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Simpler structure is easier to navigate
3. **Better Maintenance**: Fewer files and directories to manage
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Logical flow matches user mental models
5. **Scalability**: Structure can accommodate future growth

## Implementation Notes

- All existing content will be preserved and mapped to new locations
- URLs will need to be redirected to maintain existing links
- The sidebar structure will reflect the new organization
- Search functionality will benefit from clearer categorization
