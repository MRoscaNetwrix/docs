# ChangeTracker 8.1 Documentation Restructure Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the restructuring of ChangeTracker 8.1 documentation to improve information architecture, reduce complexity, and enhance user experience.

## Current Issues

- Deeply nested structure with many sub-categories
- Single-file categories that waste navigation space
- Related content scattered across different sections
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Difficult navigation due to over-categorization

## Restructure Goals

1. **Flatten the hierarchy** - Reduce nesting levels to improve discoverability
2. **Consolidate related content** - Group similar topics together
3. **Use consistent naming** - Apply title case and clear descriptive names
4. **Improve navigation** - Create logical flow from getting started to advanced topics
5. **Reduce total categories** - Merge related topics to reduce cognitive load

## New Structure Overview

### 1. Getting Started

- Consolidates introduction, overview, and what's new
- Provides clear entry point for new users

### 2. Installation & Deployment

- Groups all installation content together
- Includes hub, agent, and database configuration
- Clear separation between initial setup and upgrades

### 3. Configuration

- Central location for all configuration tasks
- Organized by configuration type (system, agent, credentials, etc.)
- Policy templates grouped logically

### 4. Monitoring & Tracking

- Combines all monitoring features in one place
- Includes FIM, baseline, cloud, and agentless monitoring
- Logical grouping of monitoring types

### 5. Administration

- Daily operational tasks and management
- Dashboard, alerts, device operations
- Compliance and planned changes

### 6. Reporting & Analytics

- All reporting features together
- Events, reports, and dashboards
- Export and scheduling options

### 7. Integrations

- Single location for all third-party integrations
- Clear organization by integration type

### 8. API Reference

- Dedicated section for API documentation
- Easy to find for developers

### 9. Reference

- System requirements and other reference materials
- Glossary for quick lookups

## Key Changes

### Consolidations

1. **Match Rules** - Merged into File Integrity Monitoring section
2. **Tabs** - Content distributed to relevant functional areas
3. **Wizards** - Integrated into their respective feature sections
4. **Settings** - Reorganized under Configuration with clearer categories

### Simplified Naming

- Removed redundant "overview" from many section names
- Used descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Applied consistent title case throughout

### Reduced Nesting

- Maximum 3 levels of nesting (was 5+ in some areas)
- Single-file categories eliminated or merged
- Related content grouped at appropriate levels

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience** - Easier to find information
2. **Better Learning Path** - Logical progression from basics to advanced
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Fewer categories to remember
4. **Consistent Organization** - Similar patterns throughout
5. **Scalable Structure** - Easy to add new content without breaking organization
