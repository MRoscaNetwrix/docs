# What's next?

Congratulations! You have understood most core features of Docusaurus now. You have:

- [Used the pages plugin](/reference-docs/docusaurus/guides/creating-pages.mdx) to create a standalone React / Markdown page
- [Used the docs plugin](/reference-docs/docusaurus/guides/docs/docs-introduction.mdx) to create documentation pages. This includes [configuring the sidebar](/reference-docs/docusaurus/guides/docs/sidebar/index.mdx), and even [versioning](/reference-docs/docusaurus/guides/docs/versioning.mdx)
- [Used the blog plugin](/reference-docs/docusaurus/blog.mdx) to create a fully featured blog
- Tried your hands on [a range of Markdown features](/reference-docs/docusaurus/guides/markdown-features/markdown-features-intro.mdx), which are useful for all content plugins
- [Used stylesheets](/reference-docs/docusaurus/styling-layout.mdx) or [swizzling](/reference-docs/docusaurus/swizzling.mdx) to customize your site's appearance
- [Included images and other assets](/reference-docs/docusaurus/static-assets.mdx) in your pages
- [Added search](/reference-docs/docusaurus/search.mdx) to your site
- Understood how [browser support](/reference-docs/docusaurus/browser-support.mdx) and [SEO](/reference-docs/docusaurus/seo.mdx) are done through standard Docusaurus APIs
- Learned about how [individual plugins](/reference-docs/docusaurus/using-plugins.mdx) are installed and configured
- [Deployed](/reference-docs/docusaurus/deployment.mdx) your site to a content host
- [Internationalized](/reference-docs/docusaurus/i18n/i18n-tutorial.mdx) your site to include multiple languages

At this point, you probably have a big `docusaurus.config.js` alreadyðŸ˜„ However, you haven't written much code yet! Most of the features are implemented through calling encapsulated Docusaurus APIs. As you continue your journey, you can take three paths:

- Learn more advanced Docusaurus concepts. This will help you gain a deeper understand of what the APIs do.
- Read about [all existing APIs](/reference-docs/docusaurus/docusaurus-core.mdx). Many of them have not been covered in the Guides!
- Learn to [develop a plugin](/reference-docs/docusaurus/api/plugin-methods/README.mdx) to extend the functionality of your site.
