# Docusaurus themes

We provide official Docusaurus themes.

## Main themes {#main-themes}

The main themes implement the user interface for the [docs](/reference-docs/docusaurus/api/plugins/plugin-content-docs.mdx), [blog](/reference-docs/docusaurus/api/plugins/plugin-content-blog.mdx) and [pages](/reference-docs/docusaurus/api/plugins/plugin-content-pages.mdx) plugins.

- [@docusaurus/theme-classic](/reference-docs/docusaurus/api/themes/theme-classic.mdx)
- ðŸš§ other themes are planned

:::warning

The goal is to have all themes share the exact same features, user-experience and configuration.

Only the UI design and underlying styling framework should change, and you should be able to change theme easily.

We are not there yet: only the classic theme is production ready.

:::

## Enhancement themes {#enhancement-themes}

These themes will enhance the existing main themes with additional user-interface related features.
