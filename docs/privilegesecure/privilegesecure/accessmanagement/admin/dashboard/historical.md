The Historical sessions dashboard shows all created sessions and their status. Only users with the Administrator role can view recordings of historical sessions.

The dashboard has the following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the table or list is filtered to the matching results. See the Searches topic for additional information.
- Filter — Provides options to filter results based on a chosen criterion:

  - All Historical tab — Shows all sessions for all users
  - Mine tab — Shows sessions for the logged in user
  - Resource Name – Filter by Host value
  - User Name — Filter by Session User
  - User Type — Filter by type of user: All, User, Application, or Local User
  - Recording data — Filter by keystroke data and, when enabled, RDP Windows event activity. See the [Install Remote Desktop Monitor Service on Target RDP Hosts](../../install/rdpmonitor.md) topic for additional information.
  - Requested date — Filter by session start and/or end dates
- Export as CSV — Generates a CSV file of the table and automatically downloads it to your browser's default download folder. The file name indicates what table was exported.
- Refresh — Reload the information displayed

The table has the following columns:

- Actions — Contains icons for available actions:

  - Expand icon — Click the expand (>) icon to show additional information for the session:

    - If a recording of the session is available, the replay viewer allows an admin to watch a replay of the remote session. See the [Replay Viewer Window](window/replayviewer.md) topic for additional information.
  - Rocket icon — Launches the same session (same activity on the same resource with the same connection profile) for any historical session that is not a Credential-based session

  - Canceled — Activity was manually canceled before its scheduled end time by an Privilege Secure administrator
  - Failed — Pre-Session stage of the Activity has encountered an error

The table columns can be resized and sorted in ascending or descending order.

## Searches

Searches can be performed across both live and previously recorded sessions. Sessions can be filtered by resource name, requesting user, user type (standard, application, or local), recording metadata (keystrokes, screen output and executed commands in Windows session), and date range. Within the filtered list, any column metadata can be searched including login account (account used to log onto target), Activity name, user session notes and ticket number. All search and filtering supports partial string matching.

When metadata is searched and a recorded session is opened, we jump to the point of the recording where the metadata first appears.
