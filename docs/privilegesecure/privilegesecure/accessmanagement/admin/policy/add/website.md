**Step 3 –** Enter the following information:

- Website Name – Displays the name to be displayed in the Resource list for the website
- Platform – Website (This field cannot be changed.)
- Logon URL – Enter the primary logon page for the website. This is only used if no URL is specified
  when defining a website Activity.
- Associated Resource – _(optional)_ If the website is hosted on a server that is also managed by
  Privilege Secure, select the resource from the drop-down list to ensure that AD account operations
  are performed on the domain controller the website resource is bound to
- Associated Domain Controller – _(optional)_ A specific domain controller may be selected to ensure
  that AD account operations are performed on a domain controller the website will reference for
  authentication
- Service Account – _(optional)_ The service account used when activity _actions_ require a
  provisioned account to interact with the resource, e.g. custom PowerShell. From the drop-down
  menu, select a previously added service account. See the
  [Service Accounts Page](../../configuration/page/serviceaccounts.md) topic for additional
  information.

    - Add New Service Account — Open the Add New Service Account window. The fields are identical to
      those on the Service Accounts page

**Step 4 –** Click **Save** to add the website to the console.

The new website has been onboarded. See the [Website Details Page](../page/details/website.md) topic
for additional information.
