# CyberArk Integration

Privilege Secure contains a built-in vault for credential management, but can uniquely map to a
CyberArk vault. CyberArk connectors can be used for the following purposes:

- Service Accounts – Use to perform Active Directory synchronization
- Activities – Use to configure the target account for the activity

CyberArk connectors use the Central Credential Provider. The Central Credential Provider provides a
REST interface that allows applications to check out passwords from a CyberArk vault. The accounts
are identified by a safe, folder, address and username. For service accounts, the username, address,
safe and folder are provided directly in the service account definition. For activities, provide the
username and address in the LoginAccountName format. The safe and folder information is provided
directly in the activity definition.
