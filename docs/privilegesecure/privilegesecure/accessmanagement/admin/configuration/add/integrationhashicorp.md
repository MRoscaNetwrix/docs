# HashiCorp Integration

Privilege Secure contains a built-in vault for credential management, but can uniquely map to a
HashiCorp vault. HashiCorp connectors can be used for the following purposes:

- Service Accounts – Use to perform Active Directory synchronization
- Activities – Use to configure the target account for the activity

HashiCorp connectors use the Active Directory Secrets Engine. The Active Directory Secrets Engine
defines a collection of usernames and passwords in each library endpoint, so when Privilege Secure
performs a checkout of the account using the library, the actual account returned may vary.

## Install Active Directory Secrets Engine

Before configuring Privilege Secure to use a HashiCorp connector, the Active Directory Secrets
Engine must be installed in the HashiCorp Vault. See the HashiCorp
[Active Directory Secrets Engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ad) article for
additional information.
