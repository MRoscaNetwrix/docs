# Netwrix Privilege Secure for Access Management v4.2 Documentation

Netwrix Privilege Secure for Access Management enables administrators and help desk professionals to
perform their day-to-day activities easily and without the complexity of traditional Privileged
Access Management (PAM) tools. As a next generation Privileged Access Management solution, Netwrix
Privilege Secure focuses on controlling the activity that needs to be performed rather than mapping
access to an account. The result is a reduced attack surface that drastically improves an
organizationâ€™s overall security posture.

Netwrix Privilege Secure enables secure, task-based administrative access delivered just-in-time and
with just-enough privilege.
