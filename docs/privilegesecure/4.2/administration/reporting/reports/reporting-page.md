# Reporting

Reports can be viewed and configured on the Reporting page. Predefined reports are available, as
well as platform-based reports based on the same data sources as the predefined reports.
Additionally, custom reports can be generated based on the predefined reports. All reports can be
downloaded as a PDF or CSV file or subscribed to via email.

## Reports Tree

The reports on the Reporting page are organized into folders in a tree menu. Reports can be added to
the Favorites folder or removed from the Favorites folder by clicking the star icon next to the
report name. Each report has a Filters tab (which allows the report to be run, downloaded, or
configured) and a Subscriptions tab (which allows the Privilege Secure user to Subscribe to the
report via email).

report name. The report tree will then be filtered down to the matching reports.
