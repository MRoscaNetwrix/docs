# Add Access Policy

Follow the steps to add access policies to the console.

_Remember,_ a connection profile is required to create an access policy. You can create one ahead of
time on the [Connection Profiles Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/admin/interface/accesspolicy/connectionprofiles/connectionprofiles.md) page or use the arrow button
to create one during these steps.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the Policy > Access Policies page.

**Step 2 –** In the Access Policy list, click the Plus icon.
