# Add Approval Workflow

An approval workflow requires that the session must be approved before the requestor of the session
can log in. Up to three Approval Tiers can be added. When the required number of approvals is
reached in a Tier, the approvers in the next Tier are notified. Each Tier must approve the request
in sequence. See the Approvals Dashboard topic for additional information on how to approve a
requested session.

Follow the steps to add an approval workflow to the console.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the Policy > **Access Policies** > Connection Profiles page.

**Step 2 –** Select the **Connection Profile** and click any field to edit.

The Add Users and Groups as Approvers window has the following features:

- Search – Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results.
- Radio buttons to filter by users or groups
- Available Users/Groups – Shows all users and groups added to the console
- Users & Groups to Add – Shows the users and groups to be added to the Workflow Tier as Approvers
- Column headers can be sorted in ascending or descending order:

    - Type – User or group
    - Name – Name of the user or group
    - User Name – User or group SAM Account Name
    - Email – User or group email address

**Step 9 –** Filter by Users or Groups, or use the Search feature.

**Step 10 –** To add a user or group to the Approval Tier as an Approver, click a row in the
Available Users/Groups table and it is immediately moved to the Users & Groups to Add table.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** It is usually desirable to add more approvers than required to approve the
request, in order to ensure that approval is granted before the escalation timeout is reached.

**Step 11 –** (Optional) Click a row in the Users & Groups to Add table to move it back to the
Available Users/Groups table.

**Step 12 –** Click **Add** to add the Approvers to the Approval Tier.

session as well.

The new Approval Workflow is added to the Connection Profile. See the Approvals Dashboard topic for
additional information on how to approve a requested session.
