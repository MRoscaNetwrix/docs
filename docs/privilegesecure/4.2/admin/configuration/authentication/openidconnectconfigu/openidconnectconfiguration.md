# OpenID Connect Configuration Wizard

The OpenID Connect Configuration wizard is opened with the **Configuration Wizard** button in the
Configuration > [Authentication Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/admin/configuration/authentication/authentication.md) for an OpenID Connect
Authentication Connector Type.

![configureclient](/img/product_docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/admin/configuration/wizard/configureclient.webp)

It contains three pages:

- Configure Client
- Test Login
- Configure Id Mapping

## Configure OpenID Connect Authentication Connector

Follow the steps to verify the OpenID Connect configuration:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Configuration** > **Authentication** page.

**Step 2 –** In the Connectors list, select the applicable authentication connector and click
**Configuration Wizard**.

**Step 3 –** On the Configure Client page, enter the following information:

- Issuer – The OpenId Connect provider issuer URI. Out-going redirection requires the correct
  “Issuer” path to be set. Incorrect settings will generally result in a 404 error.
- Client Id – The OpenId Connect provider application Id for Privilege Secure
- Callback Address – The OpenID Connect provider requires the Privilege Secure callback path to be
  authorized. Generally this is displayed by the provider after redirection. Enter the address and
  port of the Privilege Secure server:

    [protocol]//[hostname]:[port]/callback

- CORS – The OpenID Connect provider requires the Privilege Secure callback location to be
  configured for CORS. This will either be displayed by the provider after redirection, or a 500
  error is returned. If an error is returned, CORS is probably not configured with the correct
  information. Enter the address and port of the Privilege Secure server:

    [protocol]//[hostname]:[port]

:::warning
In the next step, verify that the Sign In page displays as expected, but do NOT sign in
at this step.

**Step 4 –** Click Test Connection to verify the connection configuration. This opens the Sign In
page in the browser. Do NOT sign in.

- If the Sign In page does not display as expected, review the values configured for the OpenID
  Connect connector and modify them where needed. Then, verify the Sign In page again.
- **NOTE:** When configuring OpenID Connect for Okta, it may be necessary to ensure that the Grant
  type in Okta is set to Implicit (hybrid) and the sub-settings Allow ID Token with implicit grant
  type and Allow Access Token with implicit grant type are both enabled.

**Step 5 –** Click the browser’s back arrow to return to the Configure Client wizard page.

**Step 6 –** If the Sign In page displayed as expected, click Next.

**Step 7 –** On the Test Login page, click Login. The Sign In page opens in the browser.

**Step 8 –** Enter valid credentials for the OpenID Connect provider and sign in.

**Step 9 –** If the sign in was successful, the generated access token will display. This is passed
to the UserTokenController so that the user information can be extracted. Click Next.

**Step 10 –** On the Configure ID Mapping page, click **Get User Data**.

![chapter_4_configuration_interface_6](/img/product_docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/admin/configuration/wizard/chapter_4_configuration_interface_6.webp)

Privilege Secure will use the access token to retrieve user data from the OpenId Connect provider.
The OpenID Connect provider requires a User Id Field for sign in. It is necessary to specify which
field in Active Directory should map to that User Id Field, so that Privilege Secure can
automatically fill in the required credentials at login. The value provided is used to sign in to
the multi factor authenticator (MFA) when a user logs in to the Privilege Secure Console.

In order to connect a user from the OpenID Connect provider to a user in the Privilege Secure copy
of the AD data, it is necessary to map a field in the provider list to a field in the Privilege
Secure host user table. The exact fields to map will vary between providers and according to the
user’s AD configuration.

The table displays the retrieved data that can be used for the host user lookup. The user must
select from the displayed records a field that corresponds to a value in their AD configuration. For
example, if the AD data contains email addresses, they can select any of the fields which contain
email addresses.

Field values will vary according to the information supplied by the provider. Example Values come
from the provider and will vary:

- Source – There are three ways to extract the data, depending on the provider and the application
  configuration in the provider (unfortunately, there is no consistency in how the data is
  formatted):
    - Introspection Endpoint – _(Preferred)_ Not supported by all providers. Also validates the
      token.
    - UserInfo Endpoint – Microsoft Entra ID has two User Info endpoints which return slightly
      different data sets (be sure to check both). Some providers require authorization for this
      endpoint. May otherwise validate the token.
    - Token parsing – _(Least preferred)_ The access token contains claims which include some user
      information. This is the least secure method since the token is received indirectly. This
      option should not be used unless all other options have failed.
- Field – Shows the possible fields used by the OpenID Connect provider detected by Privilege
  Secure.
- Example Value – Shows an example value for the field based on the login credentials provided in
  the previous step. This represents the format of the value that will be used to sign in to the MFA
  during log in.

    :::note
    These are not the credentials that will be used during the login process; only an
    example of the format of those credentials. The actual credentials used are unique to each user
    and are setup during the MFA registration process for that user.

**Step 11 –** Select a field to use for the User Id Field and click Select.

![chapter_4_configuration_interface_7](/img/product_docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/admin/configuration/wizard/chapter_4_configuration_interface_7.webp)

**Step 12 –** The selected Source and User ID fields from the previous table are shown. Now map the
applicable AD field to the User Id Field. This is the value that will be used to sign in to the MFA
during login. In the Login Format drop-down, select the applicable AD field to map to the User Id
Field.

**Step 13 –** Click Finish. A window will display the updated configuration settings.

![chapter_4_configuration_interface_8](/img/product_docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/admin/configuration/wizard/chapter_4_configuration_interface_8.webp)

**Step 14 –** Click Okay to close the wizard and click **Save** on the Authentication page to accept
the changes.

The Authentication Connector is configured and added to the Connectors list.
