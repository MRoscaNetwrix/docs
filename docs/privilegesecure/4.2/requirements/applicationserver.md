RAM, CPU and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the total number of administrators using Privilege Secure.

| Environment       | Extra Large | Large   | Medium | Small      |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Number of Admins  | 500-1000    | 100-500 | 50-100 | 50 or less |
| RAM               | 64 GB       | 32 GB   | 16 GB  | 16 GB      |
| Cores             | 8-16        | 6-8     | 4-6    | 4          |
| C: drive          | 80 GB       | 80 GB   | 80 GB  | 80 GB      |
| Application drive | 300 GB      | 200 GB  | 100 GB | 100 GB     |
| Recording drive   | 500 GB      | 300 GB  | 200 GB | 150 GB     |

Permissions

  privileges

## Virtual Environment Recommendations

While physical machines are always preferred, we fully support the use of virtual machines. This
section contains special considerations when leveraging virtualization.

- VMWare® ESX® – If using ESX, the following specifications are recommended:
    - ESX 4.0 / ESXi™ 4.1 or higher
    - Virtual Hardware 7 or higher
    - All Virtual Machines installed on the same datacenter / rack
- Virtual Storage Consideration
    - In the server requirements, when separate disks are required for the servers, that should
      translate to separate data stores on the VM host machine.
