# Live Session Viewer Window

The Live Session Viewer window allows a user with the Administrator role to watch a live activity
session. Activity sessions are monitored when the Record Proxy Sessions checkbox is selected in the
connection profile assigned to the access policy. All SSH and RDP keystrokes and local commands are
recorded using a granular metadata search that works across both live and recorded sessions.

Click the expand icon for an active session on the [Active Dashboard](../active.md).

If the user has logged into the activity session more than once, multiple session recordings will
display. Only the current session can be viewed live. See the
[Replay Viewer Window](replayviewer.md) topic for additional information on recorded sessions.

There are two types of Live Session Viewer windows:

- RDP session
- Website host

Select the desired recording and the Live Session Viewer window opens.
