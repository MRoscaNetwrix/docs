# Credential Policy Overrides Page

The Credential Policy Overrides page is accessible from the Policy Navigation pane under Credentials
and displays the configured Credential Policy Overrides. If a credential is added to a Credential
Policy Override, that credential's scheduled change policy and verification schedule will be
inherited from the Credential Policy Override, rather than being inherited from the credential's
platform.
