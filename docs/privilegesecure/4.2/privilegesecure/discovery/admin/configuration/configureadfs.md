In the Claim rules, you have to type in the entries as the required values are not built-in/default
to ADFS. Set the Attribute Store to Active Directory, and manually type in **distinguishedName** in
the LDAP Attribute field. In the Outgoing Claim Type field, annually type in **dn**

**NOTE:** On saving, distinguishedName will be changed to DistinguishedName (starts with capital D),
as see in the example below.  It should be entered as a lower case d.

## Privilege Secure

**Step 1 –** Navigate to **Configure** > **Server**.

**Step 2 –** As Privilege Secure is unable to perform Service Provider initiated (SP-initiated)
logon, you must specified an Identity Provider initiated (IdP-intiatied) URL.

- Entrypoint: `https://<ADFS_URL>/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx?LoginToRP=https://SecureONE_URL`
- Issuer: `http://ADFS_URL/adfs/services/trust`
- Issuer Cert: This is the Signing Certificate of your ADFS environment, excluding the headers
  (---BEGIN CERTIFICATE--- and ---END CERTIFICATE---)
- SSO Enabled: Enabled

## F5 Load Balancing

In order for F5 to work with ADFS a certificate trust must be configured between the the ADFS server
and the BIG-IP load balancer, details are listed below:
