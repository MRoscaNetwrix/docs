Below shows the recommended space that should be allocated for each Privilege Secure node. A docker
cluster should also follow the same sizing for each node:

| End points | Recommended SecureONE Node Size |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| `<500`     | 250 GB                          |
| 500 - 5000 | 500 GB                          |
| `>5000`    | 1 TB                            |
