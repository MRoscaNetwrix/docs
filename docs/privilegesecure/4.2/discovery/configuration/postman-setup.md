# Postman: Installing and Configuring

## Overview

Postman is used to run APIs that are available within Privilege Secure. These APIs are used for the
Quickstart reporting process. This can be used to configure and enroll multiple machines into
protect mode. In order to setup Quickstart reporting functionality Postman is utilized to get an API
key that is used to authenticate against Privilege Secure.

## Install Postman

Navigate to [https://www.postman.com](https://www.postman.com/) and install the latest version of
Postman. Follow the configuration steps for Postman as detailed in the article below. When first
launching Postman, it will prompt to start new from a template. Exit out of this window by clicking
the “X” in the top-right corner of this pane.

Next, select the “Import” option in the top left corner. Locate the API.postman_collection.json file
which will be supplied by a Sales Engineer or a Customer Success Team contact, and select this file
to import.

Prior to attempting to run any GET/POST requests, open the Postman Preferences and disable “SSL
certificate verification” on the left side of the “General” section:

![blobid3.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid3.webp)

![blobid4.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid4.webp)

### Setting the Base URL Environment Variable

To set the base_url variable needs to be set. Click the “eyeball” symbol:

![blobid5.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid5_96x82.webp)

The following screen will display. Click the Edit button:

![blobid6.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid6.webp)

Enter the **baseUrl** variable for your specific environment:

Note:  Older collections use **base_url**.

![mceclip1.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_mceclip1.webp)

Click Save and then exit out of the screen below:

![blobid8.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid8_612x415.webp)

## Setting Up The Token With SAML:

Open a browser that has developer tool capabilities. This example will use screenshots from Google
Chrome.  
In your Chrome browser, select the three dots in the top right corner, accessing the drop down
settings menu. Select More Tools > Developer Tools:

![blobid9.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid9.webp)

Once the Developer Tools pane is open, select the “Network” tab, and check the “Preserve log” box.
You may need to click the chevrons to be able to see the “Network” option.

![blobid10.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid10_144x49.webp)

Now, log into the Privilege Secure platform and complete the MFA/SSO process until able to see the
Dashboard. Once successfully logged in and authenticated, select the >> option in the top right of
the Developer Tools pane, and then select “Application.”

![blobid11.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid11_202x153.webp)

Inside of the “Application” section, select “Local Storage.” There will be an option here to you
select the current session connecting the machine to Privilege Secure.

![blobid12.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid12_568x268.webp)

Once selected, there is a key:value section that will appear to the right where the key is ‘token’
and the value is the JWT that needs to be copied. Ensure you use “Select All” to copy the full
key.  
This is now set as a global variable called **accessToken** inside of Postman in the same way that
the **baseUrl** variable was created above (this is done by clicking the “eyeball” icon).

Copy and paste the JWT captured from the login session into the ‘Initial Value’ and ‘Current Value’
fields for the **accessToken**:

Note:  Older collections use **current_jwt** instead of accessToken.

## Confirming the Postman Configuration

The Postman setup can now be confirmed. Open the collections, as shown below. Under “Users” click
the “User List” collection.

![blobid15.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid15_260x456.webp)

Click the “Send” button

![blobid16.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid16.webp)

The result should be a list of users in a format similar to below:

![blobid17.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid17.webp)

Note the “id” of the user that will be running Quickstart. Additional user ids can be obtained by
sending different display names. All the user ids for Quickstart users should be noted.  
An error of a “malformed key” is usually from only part of the key being saved as the “current_jwt”
variable in postman.

## Creating the API Key

Next the API Key can be created to allow the Quickstart script to be utilized. Under the “API Keys”
option click “Create API Key”

![blobid18.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid18_456x141.webp)

**Add the ID for additional “linkedUsers”. The key should ideally be generated for all the users
that will be running Quickstart. Click the send button to return the suitable key**

The API Key is returned from Privilege Secure:

![blobid19.webp](/img/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/360046209633_blobid19.webp)

Save a copy of API key in a **safe and secure. This is sensitive data!** This will need to be shared
with other users who will be using Quickstart.
