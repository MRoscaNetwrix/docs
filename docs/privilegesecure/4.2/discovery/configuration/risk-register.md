Below are a list of potential failures that could impact the running of Privilege Secure. The
mitigations suggested are approaches to resolve Privilege Secure utilization if the primary failure
point is not able to be resolved in a timely manner.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hardware failure on appliance node (cluster environment)     | Failure of hardware within a single node would not directly impact Privilege Secure functionality             | Privilege Secure functionality would not be impacted. Dell support is available                                                                                          |
| Hardware failure on appliance node (single node environment) | Failure of hardware within a single node would impact Privilege Secure functionality                          | Failover over to DR instance following predetermined procedure.                                                                                                          |
| Load balancer failure                                        | Users unable to access Privilege Secure through load balancer VIP                                             | Access can be obtained by directly connecting to a node. The DNS entry could be re-routed if necessary                                                                   |
| DNS failure                                                  | Privilege Secure URL would not work and some scans would fail if IP addresses change before resolution of DNS | Direct access to Privilege Secure via IP. Privilege Secure would fail to connect to the end points via DNS resolution, but would fall back to the last known IP address  |
| Failure on VM node (cluster environment)                     | Failure of a single VM node would not directly impact Privilege Securefunctionality                           | Privilege Secure functionality would not be impacted.                                                                                                                    |
| Failure on VM node (single node environment)                 | Failure of a single VM node would affect Privilege Secure access                                              | Utilize a snapshot or failover to a DR instance. Starting services on a DR instace would take only a few minutes along with a DNS change                                 |
| Network issue to Privilege Secure                            | All access to Privilege Secure impacted                                                                       | Break glass scenario, use a service account if the network outage is unable to be resolved timely. Rotate the credentials of the service account once access is restored |
| Network issue connecting to end point                        | No JITA to the endpoint                                                                                       | Use OAM. If OAM is not available, check network line of sight to end point using ping of IP address and DNS name                                                         |
