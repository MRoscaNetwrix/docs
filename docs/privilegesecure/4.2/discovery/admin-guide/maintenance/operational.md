# Operational Maintenance

Operational Maintenance

# Operational Maintenance

Once Privilege Secure is rolled out there are various maintenance and operational items that should
be done at regular intervals:

## Privilege Secure Processes (suggested daily)

- The Privilege Secure processes can be listed using the following command:
- s1 status; s1 nodes
- This lists the status of all containers in the docker environment for Privilege Secure. They
  should all be scaled to 1/1 in a production environment. All nodes should be listed

- The manager status should be listed as "Leader" for a single node or "Leader" and "Reachable" as
  above. The Leader is the primary manager node and the Reachable nodes are managers. In the event
  of a failure of a node an election to determine a new primary manager takes place. A single node
  can fail without any indication to users.

## Disk Maintenance (suggested weekly)

- Disk space should be checked on a periodic basis. The command to check this is: df -h
- This command is disk free with the switch h for human readable. Disk usage over 80% should be
  checked to see if there are any specific reasons for excessive disk usage. If this the space can
  not be reduced successfully, additional disc space should be added. The Customer Success team can
  assist with theÂ review and reduction of used disc space and also increase of disk space (physical
  or virtual, dependent on environment).

## Backups

Review (suggested weekly)

- Check that backups are being executed on the production node and successfully copied to DR.
- Confirm that backups with appropriate recent date exist on DR server. Backups are usually executed
  from a cron run script daily.
- If the backup is set to restore the database backup daily, check the logs for any errors.
- Production Primary Node:
- ls -lath /secureone/data/db/backups
- DR Primary Node:
- ls -lath /secureone/data/db/restore

Test (suggested minimum yearly)

- It is recommended to test DR at least yearly. This can be part of a wider DR test or specific to
  Privilege Secure.
- A test window should be created for this as changes to Privilege Secure DR would not be propagated
  back to the main production instance.
- After a test ensure that services are down on the DR node. This will avoid the DR environment
  overriding changes from Production. The command below can be utilized for this:

  - `s1 stop expire worker scanner`

## Run Quickstart to Review Protect Mode and Persistence (suggested weekly)

- Quickstart should be run frequently to ensure that all machines remain in protect mode. The output
  from Quickstart can easily be filtered for any machines that do not show in protect mode. This
  ensures that the build process and addition or protect mode is being executed as expected.
- Quickstart can also be used for a review of persistent access. This should be minimized to service
  accounts. A review to look for user accounts set to persistent should be carried out. If these are
  truly required to be persistent, then they should be switched to a service account.

## Privilege Secure Log Review - SIEM (suggested weekly)

- Typically a SIEM solution is best placed to report any issues that can be captured in Privilege
  Secure logs.
- An example set of queries for Splunk is included here:
  [Splunk and SIEM Queries](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/discovery/integrations/siem/splunk-queries.md)
- The "change system policy" output should be reviewed for any removal of protect mode.
- The "slow JITA access" and "time it takes for JITA access" can give an indication if users are
  being slowed down in their ability to elevate privilege when utilizing Privilege Secure.

## Mongo Health (suggested weekly)

Time Sync

- Run the following command to check that the servers are remaining in sync with time:
- sudo docker exec -it $(sudo docker ps | grep mongo | cut -d' ' -f1) mongo SecureONE --eval
  'rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()'
- The result should show that there is little or no difference in time:
- secureone@ip-10-100-11-27:/secureone/conf/fluentd$ sudo docker exec -it $(sudo docker ps | grep
  mongo | cut -d' ' -f1) mongo SecureONE --eval 'rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()'  
  MongoDB shell version v4.0.20  
  connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/SecureONE?gssapiServiceName=mongodb  
  Implicit session: session \{ "id" : UUID("dcab2535-4051-48df-80fd-eec1136f692b") \}  
  MongoDB server version: 4.0.20  
  source: mongo2:27017  
   syncedTo: Tue Sep 22 2020 16:03:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)  
   0 secs (0 hrs) behind the primary  
  source: mongo3:27017  
   syncedTo: Tue Sep 22 2020 16:03:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)  
   0 secs (0 hrs) behind the primary
- In the event of a variation in time, contact the Remediant Customer Success team.

Mongo status

- Run the following to ensure the mongo DB nodes are maintaining the correct state:

```
sudo docker exec -it $(sudo docker ps | grep mongo | cut -d' ' -f1) mongo SecureONE --eval 'rs.status()' | grep "name\|health\|state\|stateStr"
```

- The output of this should be

```
"name" : "mongo1:27017",
"health" : 1,
"state" : 1,
"stateStr" : "PRIMARY",
"name" : "mongo2:27017",
"health" : 1,
"state" : 2,
"stateStr" : "SECONDARY",
"name" : "mongo3:27017",
"health" : 1,
"state" : 2,
"stateStr" : "SECONDARY",
```

**NOTE:** Health should report as 1 for everything and state should be 1 or 2.

## Version and OS updates (suggested quarterly minimum)

- Ensure quarterly meeting to review updates to Privilege Secure version and OS patches/updates.
- Patches can be applied monthly. The Customer Success team can be contacted prior to updates to
  ensure no known issues.
