# Replay Viewer Window

The Replay Viewer window allows a user with the Administrator role to watch a recorded activity
session. Activity sessions are recorded when the Record Proxy Sessions checkbox is selected in the
connection profile assigned to the access policy. All SSH and RDP keystrokes and local commands are
recorded using a granular metadata search that works across both live and recorded sessions.

When recordings are available for a historical session, the expand icon is enabled on the
[Historical Dashboard](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/user-guide/common-features/session-management/historical-sessions.md).

Multiple recording can exist for a session. There are two types of Replay Viewer windows:

- RDP session
- Website host

Select the desired recording and the Replay Viewer window opens.
