# Groups Tab for Microsoft Entra ID

The Groups tab for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) shows information about the groups on the
selected resource.

**NOTE:** Groups in hybrid environments will be associated with the on-premises Active Directory
domain resource (if the on-premises domain has been synced by Privilege Secure). This view will show
cloud-only EntraID groups.
