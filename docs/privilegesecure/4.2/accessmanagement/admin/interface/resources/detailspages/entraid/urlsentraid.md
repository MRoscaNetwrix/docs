# URLs Tab for Microsoft Entra ID

The URLs tab for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) shows information about the URLs associated
to the selected resource. URLs are correlated to launching activities in the browser extension. If a
given site is not listed here, the activity login may fail as it is not an authorized site for
login.
