  can be used to stop the resource scan. This scan can also be scheduled from the
  [Platforms Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/platforms/overview.md).

  scan of the resource, but will not be automatically changed during subsequent host scans.

  WinRM HTTPS will be trusted when the host is first scanned. Otherwise, the NPS administrator needs

      the Event table. If a SIEM connection is configured, an event will be sent to SIEM as well.
