# Import the License File

Netwrix Privilege Secure comes with a temporary 30-day trial license. a banner at the top indicates
the expiration date of a license about to expire.

However, you can import your license file on the About page (User Options > About). An expired
license does not necessarily prevent users from logging in. If a license is expired, and the login
attempt does not exceed the license count, users will still be able to log in. If a license is
expired, and the login attempt does exceed the license count, Privilege Secure will prevent the
login.

Licensing is done according to user count. Any user who has provisioned access will consume a
license after their first login. This is true for all users, regardless of role.

**CAUTION:** If your license is expired, and you can still log in, you will not be able to create
activity sessions or add new users.

**Step 1 –** Login to the Privilege Secure console as an administrator.

**Step 2 –** Click the User icon in the upper-right corner beside your login name to open the User
Options menu.
