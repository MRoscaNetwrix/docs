# Manage Internal Service Accounts

An internal service account is a type of service account used by Privilege Secure with no
dependencies (windows services or scheduled tasks). When an internal service account (Managed Type
_Internal_) is selected and set to be managed by Privilege Secure, a pop up window will display and
Privilege Secure searches for a matching user.

If a matching user is found, there are three options to manage the selected account.

- Automatic — Manages the account and password automatically
- Manual — Manages the account and password manually
- Cancel — Closes the window with no changes to the account

If the message “No matching user found” is displayed, Privilege Secure is unable to find a matching
user in Active Directory.

Try the following possible solutions to resolve:

- Perform an AD Sync to collect the latest AD data from the domain. See the
  [Domain Details Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/admin/interface/resources/detailspages/domain/domain.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Check the user is added to the Privilege Secure console. See the
  [Users & Groups Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/admin/interface/usersgroups/usersgroups.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Check the spelling of the Username associated with the service account. See the
  [Service Accounts Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/admin/interface/serviceaccounts/serviceaccounts.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Make sure the user is in Active Directory in the expected domain

## Manually Manage an Internal Service Account

If the manual option is selected, a new window will open to set the password for the credential.

After the password is created, click **Save** to update the password. The account password has been
updated and the service account can be manually managed.

The selected account will now display the following options.

- Set Password icon — Opens the Set Password for Credential window to set a new password for the
  selected account.
- Clipboard icon — Copies the password for the selected account
- Information icon — Opens the View Password window to view the password and copy it to the
  clipboard. The window stays open for 20 seconds. See the
  [View Password Window](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/admin/interface/credentials/viewpassword.md)
  topic for additional information.
