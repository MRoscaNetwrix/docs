# Role Management Page

The Role Management page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Users & Group. It provides
details on all available roles for Privilege Secure users. There are default roles, and custom roles
can be created.

The pane on the left side of the page displays a list of the configured roles. This pane has the
following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results.
- Blue + button — Create a new role. See the
  [Add Custom Role](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/admin/interface/usersgroups/rolemanagement/customrole.md)
  for additional information.
- Copy icon — Clones a role and adds a new entry to the Role list
- Trashcan icon — Deletes the access policy. Icon appears when policy is hovered over. A
  confirmation window will display.

:::note
The default Administrator, User, and Reviewer roles cannot be copied, deleted, or
modified. Only custom roles can be copied, deleted, or modified.
