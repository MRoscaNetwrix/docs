# Authentication Page

The Authentication page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Configuration. It shows the
configured multi-factor authentication (MFA) or other third-party authentication connectors such as
OpenID Connector and SAML.

Once configured, an authentication method must be assigned to the users who will use the method for
accessing the application. See the
[Authentication Connector Tab](/versioned_docs/privilegesecure_4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/tab/usersgroups/authenticationconnector.md)
topic for additional information.

The pane on the left side of the page displays a list of the configured authentication connectors.
This pane has the following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results.
-   - button — Create a new connector. See the
      [Add Authentication Connector](/versioned_docs/privilegesecure_4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/configuration/add/authenticationconnector.md)
      topic for additional information.
- Default icon — Indicates if connector is set as default. Icon appears when activity is hovered
  over. Click the icon to change or clear the default.
- Trashcan icon — Deletes the connector. Icon appears when activity is hovered over. A confirmation
  window will display.

The selected connector details display at the top of the main pane:

- Name — Displays the name of the authentication connector
- Description — Description of the policy
- Connector Type — Indicates the type of authentication: MFA, OpentID Connect, and SAML. Remaining
  fields vary based on the type selected.

If any of these settings are modified, Save and Cancel buttons are displayed. Click **Save** to
commit the modifications. Click **Cancel** to discard the modifications.

## MFA Connector Type

The following fields apply to the MFA Connector Type:

- Server FQDN / IP — Address of the RADIUS server proxy
- Remote Port — Port of the RADIUS server proxy
- Auth Type — Security protocol used for communications between the Privilege Secure server and the
  RADIUS proxy
- Shared Secret — Shared secret for the RADIUS proxy
- Max Retries — Indicates how many times the Privilege Secure server will attempt to communicate
  with the RADIUS proxy
- Timeout (Seconds) — Indicates how long before Privilege Secure determines that the communication
  with the RADIUS proxy has failed
- Title for MFA Auth Dialog — Title that will appear at the top of the authentication dialog
- Text for MFA Auth Dialog — Text that will be displayed to the user prompting for action
- Send NAS Identifier checkbox — Indicates if the NAS identifiers are transmitted to the RADIUS
  proxy. This is required for certain RADIUS proxy implementations that require it. The NAS IP
  Address value is the IP address of the Privilege Secure server; the NAS Identifier is “SbPAM”.
- Send Initial Text checkbox — Indicates if the value in the Initial Auto Response Text is
  automatically sent to the RADIUS proxy without user action
- Initial Auto Response Text — This value is sent to the RADIUS server automatically if the Send
  Initial Text option is enabled. For example, this might be “push” to immediately have the user’s
  phone app prompt for authorization.
- Prefix for Response Text — Displays the value that is added to the beginning of the responses. The
  value will vary according to server.
- Format for Username (Allows Custom Entries) — Displays the Username value that is sent to the
  RADIUS server (default: SAMAccountname@NetBiosDomain). This format will be used by the
  authenticator at log in. If configured to use "Email" or "UPN" (optional attributes) the
  authenticator will use that format at log in, but send the default value to the RADIUS server.

- Show / Hide Data link — Click the link to view or hide additional details
- Issuer — Displays the OpenID Connect provider issuer URI
- Client Id — Displays the OpenID Connect provider application Id for Privilege Secure
- Login Format — Indicates which Active Directory user ID property is used for the user login name:
  sAMAccountName, User Principal Name, Email, or SID
- User Id Source — Displays the source from which the User Id data is extracted

## SAML Connector Type

The following fields apply to the SAML Connector Type:

- Configuration Wizard button — Opens the Configuration Wizard for the selected type of connector.
