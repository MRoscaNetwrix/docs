# Create Resource Import CSV File

Resources can be onboarded via a CSV import process. Create a CSV file with the following values:

- DNS Host Name — Displays the fully qualified domain name for the resource
- Operating System — Displays the operating system of the resource. This is an optional value.
- IP Address — Displays the IP address for the resource
- Platform — Displays the type of platform, which defines the resource. This is an optional value,
  but it must be an exact match to known platforms on the
  [Platforms Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/platforms/overview.md).
- Credential — Displays the service account associated with the resource. This is an optional value,
  but it must be an exact match to known service accounts on the
  [Service Accounts Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/configuration/page/serviceaccounts.md).

The CSV file must contain one resource per row. Each resource must be identified by either a DNS
Host Name or an IP Address. All other values are optional.
