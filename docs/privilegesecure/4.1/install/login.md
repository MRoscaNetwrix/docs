# Log Into the Privilege Secure Console

Once installation is complete, Privilege Secure is accessible locally on the default port:

https://localhost:6500

Since Privilege Secure is a browser-based application, it is possible to access the web interface
remotely. In most environments, enter the URL for the host on which Privilege Secure is installed
into a supported browser address bar. For example, if Privilege Secure is installed on server
`ExampleServer01`, then the address is:

https://ExampleServer01:6500

:::note
This is the default port. If a custom port is configured, the address to the Privilege
Secure Console is:
:::


`https://ExampleServer01:[PortNumber]`

Depending on the organization’s network environment, use the NetBIOS name, fully qualified domain
name (FQDN), or IP Address of the server in the browser. Also, access can be restricted through
firewalls.

Users can still log in with an expired license. If a license is expired, and the login attempt does
not exceed the license count, users will still be able to log in. If a license is expired, and the
login attempt does exceed the license count, Privilege Secure will prevent the login.

:::warning
If your license is expired, and you can still log in, you will not be able to create
activity sessions or new users.

Follow the steps to log in to the Privilege Secure Console.

**Step 1 –** Open Privilege Secure in a browser window. The Login screen will show the
Authentication Connector that is set as the default.

:::note
Privilege Secure requires a multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution (Authenticator,
DUO, Symantec VIP, etc) for all user accounts unless otherwise configured in the Initial Set Up
Wizard. If required, first time users must register with an MFA to use with their login credentials.

Different Account** to display all of the authentication connectors that are registered with
Privilege Secure.

The Privilege Secure Console is ready to use. Note that the option to view the recovery codes is no
longer available after the initial login. From here, create Sessions and Access Policies, manage
Users and Resources, and review usage data.
