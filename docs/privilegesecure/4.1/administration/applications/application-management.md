# Add Application

Applications are a special type of user that allow external entities to interact with Privilege
Secure via the REST API interface. Capabilities within the product are identical to standard users
with the exception that Applications are not able to log on through the product UI. Each Application
has a unique name that is used to identify the application calling the API; authentication is via a
combination of certificate serial number and API key.
