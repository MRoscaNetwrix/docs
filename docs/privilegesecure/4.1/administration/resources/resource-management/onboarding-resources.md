# Add Resources Window

The Add Resources window is for onboarding resources. The features within the window change based on
the onboarding method:

## Import from AD

When the Import from AD option is selected, the Add Resources window provides a list of resources
found via Active Directory sync.

  table or list is filtered to the matching results.

  [Service Accounts Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/configuration/services/service-accounts.md)

- Cancel — Discards modifications and closes the window

Both tables have the following columns:

- Type — Classification of the activity
- Name — Displays the name of the resource

drop-down menu. Select a previously added service account with credentials for the selected
resources.

Follow the steps to onboard resources by importing from a CSV file.

_Remember,_ the CSV file must contain either the DNS Host Name or IP Address for each resource. All
other values are options. Also, the Platform and Credentials value must be an exact match to
Platforms and Service Accounts already known to Privilege Secure.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to either the Resources dashboard or the Resources page.

**Step 2 –** Click the Add button and select New Server. The Add Resources window will open to

Template to download the `nps-resource-import-template.csv` file with required columns.

**Step 4 –** Click Import CSV. The Open window opens.

**Step 5 –** Navigate to the desired CSV file and click Open.

**Step 6 –** The data is read into the table. There is a validation process taking place. If an
issue arises, a red icon will indicate the problem. If a problem occurs, you can either fix the CSV
file and reimport the file, or you can select the resource with the issue and click Remove.

**Step 7 –** Repeat steps 4-6 to import multiple CSV files.

**Step 8 –** When the table is populated as desired, open the Service Account drop-down menu. Select
a previously added service account with credentials for the selected resources. The selection will
populate the Service Account value for resources without an assigned Credential from the import

window closes.
