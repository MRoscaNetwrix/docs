# Administration

Netwrix Privilege Secure enables administrators and helpdesk professionals to perform their
day-to-day activities easily and without the complexity of traditional Privileged Access Management
(PAM) tools. As a next generation Privileged Access Management solution, Privilege Secure focuses on
controlling the activity that needs to be performed rather than mapping access to an account. The
result is a reduced attack surface that drastically improves an organization’s overall security
posture.

Privilege Secure has been designed from the ground up to be simple to deploy, easy to administer and
contains many out of the box activities to help organizations be productive within hours.

The product provides the following benefits:

- Activity-based sessions for any administrative function including Active Directory / Exchange
  management, server administration, database and application management.
- Zero Trust security architecture to ensure that all privileged access is always authenticated.
- Just in time permissions ensures that the user is granted specific rights to perform the activity
  at the time it is required, and only until the activity is complete.
- Delegated permissions for granular task-specific applications or full administrative access.
- Supports interactive sessions to server desktop/CLI, auto-application launch and privileged task
  automation.

The purpose of this guide is to provide Netwrix Privilege Secure users with the information needed
to navigate and use the Privilege Secure Console.
