# Governance

Identity Manager's governance features intend to provide tools that control assignments of entitlements and measure IGA policies efficiency. Control over the assignments is achieved by designing a role model, automating assignments, using the risk management module, and performing certification campaigns. Measuring policies efficiency is enabled by reporting and auditing capabilities.

Reporting, access certification campaigns and risk management are three important tools that complete the governance arsenal.

## Reporting

With reporting features, stakeholders can measure the effect of IGA policies on the assignment landscape and adjust if needed. Governance also helps produce audit-ready reports. You can start to set up governance features relatively early in your Identity Manager journey and measure your progress from the very start.

Identity Manager puts users in control of their reporting. Rich features, such as the query module, help produce custom reports that can be used to check the assignment policy results, or gather information for an audit.

## Access Certification Campaigns

A certification campaign is a recurring event, scheduled for example every week, month or year, during which managers review their team members' entitlements. Sensitive assignments are then kept or removed.

Certification campaigns are the best way to make sure past assignment decisions are still in the best interest of the organization. They can be a good way to mitigate a lack of automation in your assignment decisions concerning, for example, movers or leavers.

Identity Manager's certification module also helps managers produce accurate reports that they can present to an auditor.

See the [Access Certification](/docs/product_docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/governance/accesscertification/index.md) topic to learn how to configure certification campaigns.

## Risk Management

The risk management module provides tools for identifying entitlement assignments that pose a security risk. The module facilitates the analysis and mitigation of different kinds of risks such as Segregation of Duties (SoD) or High Privilege. Risks can be used to identify sensitive assignments that should be reviewed first during a certification campaign.
