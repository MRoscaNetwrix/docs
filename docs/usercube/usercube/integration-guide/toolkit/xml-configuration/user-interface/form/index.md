# Form

A form contains a set of input fields (called controls) to be filled by a user, in a structured way. A form must have a form type to be displayed and used in the UI. A form without a type can be called in another form.

## Examples

The following example shows a form called ```Directory_UserRecord_View``` that involves resources from the entity type ```Directory_UserRecord``` to collect personal data and contract information via some structured fields to fill.

Code attributes enclosed with <> need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

```
<Form Identifier="Directory_UserRecord_View" EntityType="Directory_UserRecord">  
    <Control DisplayName_L1="Personal Data" OutputType="LayoutFieldset">        <Control DisplayName_L1="Full Name" OutputType="LayoutRowset">            <Control Binding="LastName" />            <Control Binding="FirstName" />        </Control>        <Control Binding="Mail" ColumnSize="8" />    </Control>    <Control DisplayName_L1="Contract" OutputType="LayoutFieldset">        <Control Binding="EmployeeId" />        <Control Binding="ContractStartDate" />        <Control Binding="ContractEndDate" />        ...  
    </Control>  
</Form>
```

### Display settings

The display settings allow you to adjust the display.

Hide the "Access Permissions" tab

When ```HideRoles``` is set to ```true```, then the __Access Permissions__ tab is not accessible.

Adjust the request type

When ```WorkflowRequestType``` is set to ```Self```, then the finalization step looks like:

When ```WorkflowRequestType``` is set to ```Helpdesk```, then the finalization step looks like:

## Child Element: Control

A form control is an input field to be filled by a user. Controls can be inserted in other controls in order to display the form fields in a structured way.

### Examples

The following example shows a form called ```Directory_UserRecord_View``` that collects first personal data via some controls, and then calls another form ```Workflow_Directory_User_AddRecord_Base``` to collect record information.
In this example is a tree control which defines the relationships between a worker and their managers (N+1 to N+3). The aim is to display in the form (in the UI) the organization chart made of the worker and their managers.

Code attributes enclosed with <> need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

```
<Form Identifier="Directory_UserRecord_View" EntityType="Directory_UserRecord">    <Control DisplayName_L1="Personal Data" OutputType="LayoutFieldset">        <Control DisplayName_L1="Full Name" OutputType="LayoutRowset">            <Control Binding="LastName" />            <Control Binding="FirstName" />        </Control>        <Control Binding="Mail" ColumnSize="8" />    </Control>    <Control DisplayName_L1="Contract" OutputType="TransformImport" EmbeddedForm="Workflow_Directory_User_AddRecord_Base" />    </Control>  
    </Form>
```
