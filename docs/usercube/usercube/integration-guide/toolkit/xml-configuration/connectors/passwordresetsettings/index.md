# Password Reset Settings

This set of password reset settings contains the configuration to perform password reset operations such as change, reset, etc.

## Examples

The following example declares a password reset settings.

```

    <PasswordResetSettings Identifier="default" BeneficiaryEmailBinding="AssignedResourceType:Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.Mail"
        BeneficiaryFullNameBinding="AssignedResourceType:Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.InternalDisplayName"
        NotifiedEmailBinding="AssignedResourceType:Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.Organization.Manager.MainRecord.Mail"
        NotifiedFullNameBinding="AssignedResourceType:Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.Organization.Manager.MainRecord.InternalDisplayName"
        Mode="1" DefaultPassword="Usercube@2019" MustChange="true"
        AutoGenerate="false" DisableNotifications="false" GeneratedLength="12" />

```

### Password length and counts

The following example makes Identity Manager generate a password with at least 12 characters in total, at least 8 lowercase characters, 4 uppercase characters, 2 digits and 2 symbols.

```

<PasswordResetSettings AutoGenerate="true" GeneratedLength="12" GeneratedLowerCaseCharsCount="8" GeneratedUpperCaseCharsCount="4" GeneratedDigitCharsCount="2" GeneratedSymbolCharsCount="2"/>

```

As the total of all counts (16) is greater than the length (12), the password length will be the count total (16).

The following example makes Identity Manager generate a password with at least 12 characters in total, at least 8 lowercase characters, 4 uppercase characters, 2 digits and 2 symbols.

```

<PasswordResetSettings AutoGenerate="true" GeneratedLength="8" GeneratedLowerCaseCharsCount="1" GeneratedUpperCaseCharsCount="1" GeneratedDigitCharsCount="1" GeneratedSymbolCharsCount="1"/>

```

As the total of all counts (4) is lower than the length (8), the password will be generated with 8 characters, among them 1 lowercase character, 1 uppercase character, 1 digit, 1 symbol, and 4 more random characters.

The generated password's strength can also be checked via a regular expression (regex) through ```StrengthCheck```. Thus, the following example makes Identity Manager generate a password with at least 9 characters including at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase and one special character.

```

<PasswordResetSettings AutoGenerate="true" StrengthCheck="'^..........*$','^.*[0-9].*$', '^.*[a-z].*$', '^.*[A-Z].*$', '^.*[^A-Za-z0-9].*$'"/>

```
