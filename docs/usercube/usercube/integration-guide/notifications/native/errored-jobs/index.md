# Jobs with Errors

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when a job ends with an error. The notification email is sent to the user who has the necessary rights and the permission.

See the [
Native Notifications
](/docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/notifications/native/index.md) and [
Profiles & Permissions
](/docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/profiles-permissions/index.md) topics for additional information.
