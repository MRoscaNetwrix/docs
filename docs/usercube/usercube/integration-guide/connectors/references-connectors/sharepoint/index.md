# SharePoint

This connector exports sites, folders, groups and permissions from a
[SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration) instance.

## Overview

SharePoint is a system used by organizations to store, organize, share and access information.

## Prerequisites

Implementing this connector requires an account with the permissions to access all items and read
their entitlements.

### Configuration

This process is configured through a connection in the UI and/or the XML configuration, and in the
`appsettings.agent.json > Connections` section:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
                 
                        appsettings.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "<ConnectionIdentifier>": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
                
```

The identifier of the connection and thus the name of the subsection must:

- Be unique.
- Not begin with a digit.
- Not contain `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`, `*` and `_`.

The following example scans the example.sharepoint.com SharePoint at the more detailed level
(ListItem) with the account [account.example@acme.com](mailto:account.example@usercube.com):

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
appsettings.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "SharePointExport": {
        "Server": "https://example.sharepoint.com/",
        "Scanlevel": "ListItem",
        "Login": "account.example@usercube.com",
        "Password": "account'sexamplepassword",
        "CsvUrls": "C:/Usercube/source/SP_others.csv¤URL¤,"
    }
  }
}
```

| CsvUrls optional                  | String    | Path, column and separator (split by ¤) of the CSV file containing the other sites to be scanned. Useful when scanning a SharePoint with a root site (https://example.sharepoint.com) with other sites (https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/OtherSite) which are not sub-sites (https://example.sharepoint.com/SubSite). Sub-sites don't need to be provided through a CSV file because they are found from the root site. |

### Limitations

Synchronization in incremental mode does not retrieve user account changes, because SharePoint is
not able to provide this information through its API.

To avoid unnecessary scanning and to increase performance, the connector in incremental mode does
not scan user accounts from the sites given through CsvUrls. However, it still retrieves the
folders, groups, permissions and the links between users and these elements.

When needing to retrieve all of user account information, then go through complete synchronization
instead of incremental.

### Output details

This connector is meant to generate to the Export Output folder the following CSV files:

`<connectionIdentifier>_Entity.csv`, with the following columns:

- **command**— empty for complete synchronization, and `merge` for incremental;

- **Key**— concatenation (with `|`) of the `Collection` and the relative URLs where the object was
  found;

- **HasUniqueRoleAssignments**— `true` if entitlement inheritance is blocked for this securable
  object;

`<connectionIdentifier>_SecurableObjectRightInheritance.csv`, with the following columns:

- **command**;
- **Collection**;

  found;
- **Collection**;
- **Level**;
- **Label**;
- **ParentKey**;
- **HasUniqueRoleAssignments**.

## Fulfill

Identity Manager's fulfill functionality can add and remove members from existing SharePoint groups.

### Configuration

Same as for export, fulfill is configured through connections.

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
appsettings.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "SharePointFulfillment": {
        "Server": "https://example.sharepoint.com/",
        "Scanlevel": "ListItem",
        "Login": "account.example@usercube.com",
        "Password": "account'sexamplepassword",
        "CsvUrls": "C:/Usercube/source/SP_others.csv¤URL¤,"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Setting attributes

| Name                          | Type   | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login required                | String | Login of the account used to access files and read their entitlements.                         |
| Password required             | String | Password of the account used to access files and read their entitlements.                      |
| Server required               | String | URL of the SharePoint website to scan.                                                         |
| Domain optional               | String | Domain, sometimes needed in addition to Login to make the connection to the SharePoint server. |
| TimeOut default value: 300000 | Int32  | Timeout (in milliseconds) for requests.                                                        |

### Password reset

This connector does not reset passwords.

### Credential protection

Data protection can be ensured through:

- RSA encryption, configured in the `appsettings.encrypted.agent.json` file;
- An Azure Key Vault safe;

| Attribute | Naming Convention for the Key in Azure Key Vault |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Domain    | `Connections--<identifier>--Domain`              |
| Login     | `Connections--<identifier>--Login`               |
| Password  | `Connections--<identifier>--Password`            |
| Scanlevel | `Connections--<identifier>--Scanlevel`           |
| TimeOut   | `Connections--<identifier>--TimeOut`             |
| Server    | `Connections--<identifier>--Server`              |
| CsvUrls   | `Connections--<identifier>--CsvUrls`             |

- A CyberArk Vault able to store SharePoint's `Login` and `Password`.

See the
[ RSA Encryption ](../../../network-configuration/agent-configuration/rsa-encryption/index.md),
[Azure Key Vault](../../../network-configuration/agent-configuration/azure-key-vault/index.md), and
[CyberArk's AAM Credential Providers ](../../../network-configuration/agent-configuration/cyberark-application-access-manager-credential-providers/index.md)topics
for additional information.

Protected attributes are stored inside a safe in CyberArk, into an account whose identifier can be
retrieved by Identity Manager from `appsettings.cyberark.agent.json`.

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
                        
                            appsettings.cyberark.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "SharePointFulfill": {
        "Login": "SharePointSettings",
        "Password": "SharePointSettings"
    }
  }
}
                    
```
