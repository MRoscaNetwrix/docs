# SingleRole

A single role is a way to represent an entitlement that is to be assigned to an identity. It brings
a layer of abstraction through a user-friendly name, close to the business view.

Roles can be used to:

- grant accesses of various types and levels;
- restrict access to sensitive information assets, by grouping entitlements in a form that is
  meaningful from a business point of view;
- grant the minimum privileges required by an individual to perform his/her job.

Roles can be requested manually, or they can be configured to be assigned automatically via
[single role rules](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md)
depending on identities' attributes.

## Examples

The following example declares a new single role in the default policy; in the category `Internet`;
for resources from `Directory_User`; with one approval needed.

```

    <SingleRole Identifier="DL-INTERNET-ALL" DisplayName_L1="Unlimited Internet access"
        Category="Internet" ApprovalWorkflowType="One" EntityType="Directory_User" Policy="Default" />

```

### Parameterized roles

The role catalog can be optimized by reducing the number of roles, by configuring parameterized
roles.
[See how to via the UI](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/user-guide/optimize/parameterized-role/index.md).

This optimization will simplify the functional understanding of the role catalog, and speed up
Usercube's calculations.

Supposing that the 10th
[dimension](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/metadata/dimension/index.md)
(dimension A following the
[base32hex convention](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/parameter-names/index.md))
is created for time slots, the following example creates a single role `Access/A_Brune_HR` for all
time slots. Each time-slot-related entitlement will be assigned to users by configuring one
navigation rule per entitlement, using the dimension as a required parameter.

```

<SingleRole Identifier="Access/A_Brune_HR" DisplayName_L1="Zone - Brune - HR" DisplayName_L2="Zone - Brune - RH" Category="Access" ApprovalWorkflowType="One" EntityType="Directory_User" Policy="Default" RA="1" /><ResourceType ... >    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_5/7_8/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_5/7_8/24" />    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_5/7_12/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_5/7_12/24" />    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_7/7_24/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_7/7_24/24" /></ResourceType>

```
