# AccessControlRule

An access control rule gives to a profile a set of permissions on a data set represented by an
entity type.

The rule contains filters to restrict its application, and entries to grant or deny the permissions.

## Examples

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```

<AccessControlRule Profile="Administrator" EntityType="Resource" Identifier="Administrator_Resource" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_Resource">  <Entry Permission="/Connectors/SynchronizeSession" CanExecute="true" />  <Entry Permission="/Connectors/ProvisioningSession" CanExecute="true" /></AccessControlRule><AccessControlRule Profile="Administrator" EntityType="Connector" Identifier="Administrator_Connector" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_Connector">  <Entry Permission="/Connectors/Connector/Query" CanExecute="true" />  <Entry Permission="/" /></AccessControlRule><AccessControlRule Profile="Administrator" EntityType="WorkflowInstance" Identifier="Administrator_WorkflowInstance" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_WorkflowInstance">  <Entry Permission="/Workflows/WorkflowInstanceData/Query" CanExecute="true" />  <Entry Permission="/Workflows/WorkflowInstance/Query" CanExecute="true" />  <Entry Permission="/" /></AccessControlRule>

```

| EntityType required     | Int64  | Identifier of the entity type that forms the data set on which the rule's permissions are applied. **NOTE:** The entity type can be part of the custom entity model, e.g. `Directory_User` or `AD_Entry`, or part of the built-in entity model, e.g. `AssignedSingleRole` or `Workflows` or `AccessCertificationItem`. |
| Identifier required     | String | Unique identifier of the access control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Child Element: Entry

AccessControlEntry grants or denies a permission to a user. Access Control Entries are part of an
Access Control Rule that defines the users scope of responsibility in the Usercube UI/Workflows.

**NOTE:** If your configuration contains an access control entry with `Permission="/"` and
`CanExecute="true"` then an error will occur during the configuration deployment, as a profile
should not possess such a big permission.

### Properties

| Property                                  | Type    | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Child Element: Filter

An access control filter restricts the application of the access control rule to a given subset of
the data set. The rule will give the specified permissions to the profile only on the parts of the
rule's data set for which the filter's condition is met.

_Remember,_ the ViewHistory permission (/Custom/Resources/Entity_Type/ViewHistory) does not work if
a filter is added.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<AccessControlRule Profile="Manager" EntityType="Directory_User" Identifier="Administrator_LDAP_Entry_History__" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_LDAP_Entry_History_">
    <Entry Permission="/Custom/Resources/Directory_User/ViewHistory" CanExecute="true" />
  </AccessControlRule>
```

This condition is actually a comparison expression between two elements:

- The value of a property which is originating from an entity targeted by the rule
- A comparison value that can be constant, or originating from the user profile

![Access Control Filter Schema](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/accesscontrolfilter_schema.webp)

### Examples

Filter on a constant value

The following example gives to the `Administrator` profile certain permissions on user data, but
only concerning users working in the marketing department.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```

<AccessControlRule Profile="Administrator" EntityType="Directory_User" Identifier="Administrator_Directory_User_Marketing" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_Directory_User_Marketing">
  <Filter Binding="MainOrganization.Code" Value="Marketing" />
  <Entry Permission="..." ... />  ...
</AccessControlRule>

```

Technically speaking, the filter here says that the rule's permissions apply only on users from
`Directory_User` whose `Code` of `MainOrganization` is `Marketing`.

Filter on the account of the current user

The following example gives to the `Manager` profile certain permissions on user data, but only
concerning users from the team managed by the current user.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```

<AccessControlRule Profile="Manager" EntityType="Directory_UserRecord" Identifier="Directory_UserRecord_Managers" DisplayName_L1="Directory_UserRecord_Managers">
  <Filter Binding="Manager.Id" CurrentUser="true" />
  <Entry Permission="..." ... />  ...
</AccessControlRule>

```

Technically speaking, the filter here says that the rule's permissions apply only on the users'
records from `Directory_UserRecord` whose `Id` of `Manager` is the identifier of the account used by
the current user to authenticate to Usercube.

Filter on the context(s) of the assigned profile(s) of the current user

The following example gives to the `Manager` profile certain permissions on user data, but only
concerning users working in the same department as the current user.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```

<AccessControlRule Profile="Manager" EntityType="Directory_User" Identifier="Manager_MainDepartment_Directory_UserRecord" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_MainDepartment_Directory_UserRecord">
  <Filter Binding="MainDepartment.Id" Dimension="Department" />
  <Entry Permission="..." ... />  ...
</AccessControlRule><Dimension Identifier="Department" DisplayName_L1="Department" EntityType="Directory_Department" ColumnMapping="3" />

```

Technically speaking, the filter here says that the rule's permissions apply only on the users from
`Directory_User` whose `Id` of `MainDepartment` is the same identifier as the value set for the
`Department` dimension of the current user, in at least one of their assigned profiles.

For example, Timothy Callahan is here assigned the `Manager` profile with the `Department` dimension
set to `Treasury/Chief Economist`.

![Matching Assigned Profile](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/assignedprofile_example_v603.webp)

Thus, with the previous access control rule, Timothy Callahan will get certain permissions on users
whose main department is `Treasury/Chief Economist`.

The following example gives to the `RoleOfficerByCategory` profile certain permissions on assigned
single roles, but only concerning the roles of a category assigned to the current user.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```

<AccessControlRule Identifier="RoleOfficerByCategory_AssignedSingleRole_ReviewRoles" DisplayName_L1="Role Officer - Review Roles" EntityType="AssignedSingleRole" Profile="RoleOfficerByCategory">
  <Filter Binding="SingleRole.Category.Id" Category="true" />
  <Entry Permission="..." ... />  ...
</AccessControlRule>

```

Technically speaking, the filter here says that the rule's permissions apply only on the assigned
single roles whose `Id` of the `Category` of the `SingleRole` is the same identifier as the value
set for the `Category` property of the current user, in at least one of their assigned profiles.

Multiple filters

The following example gives to the `RoleOfficerByCategory` profile the permission to review the
roles of users from `Directory_User`, but only the roles of a category assigned to the current user,
and whose assignment is stated as pending the first approval out of 1, 2 or 3.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<AccessControlRule Identifier="RoleOfficerByCategory_AssignedSingleRole_ReviewRoles_Directory_User_8" DisplayName_L1="Role Officer - Review Roles" EntityType="AssignedSingleRole" Profile="RoleOfficerByCategory">
  <Filter Binding="Role.Category.Id" Category="true" />  <Filter Binding="WorkflowState" Value="8" />
  <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/ProvisioningPolicy/ReviewRoles/Directory_User" /></AccessControlRule><AccessControlRule Identifier="RoleOfficerByCategory_AssignedSingleRole_ReviewRoles_Directory_User_9" DisplayName_L1="Role Officer - Review Roles" EntityType="AssignedSingleRole" Profile="RoleOfficerByCategory">
  <Filter Binding="Role.Category.Id" Category="true" />  <Filter Binding="WorkflowState" Value="9" />
  <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/ProvisioningPolicy/ReviewRoles/Directory_User" /></AccessControlRule><AccessControlRule Identifier="RoleOfficerByCategory_AssignedSingleRole_ReviewRoles_Directory_User_11" DisplayName_L1="Role Officer - Review Roles" EntityType="AssignedSingleRole" Profile="RoleOfficerByCategory">
  <Filter Binding="Role.Category.Id" Category="true" />  <Filter Binding="WorkflowState" Value="11" />
  <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/ProvisioningPolicy/ReviewRoles/Directory_User" /></AccessControlRule>
```

Technically speaking, the filter here says that the rule's permissions apply only on the assigned
single roles:

- Whose `Id` of the `Category` of the `SingleRole` is the same identifier as the value set for the
  `Category` property of the current user, in at least one of their assigned profiles, and
- Whose `WorkflowState` is set to 8 or 9 or 11, which mean respectively pending approval 1/1, 1/2
  and 1/3.
