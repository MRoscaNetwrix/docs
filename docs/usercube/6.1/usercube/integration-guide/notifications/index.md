# Notifications

Usercube is able to send notification emails when an action is expected, or a job ends with an
error.

Usercube provides
[native notifications](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/notifications/native/index.md)
for usual cases, for example provisioning review, resource reconciliation, and role reconciliation.

[Custom notifications](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/notifications/custom/index.md)
can be configured for specific needs, to be triggered by a workflow, or periodically via a task.
