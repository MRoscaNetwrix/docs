# Role Model

The role model, with its computation and enforcement, is at the heart of Usercube's engine. It is
composed mainly of roles, representing entitlements, and rules, enforcing the company assignment
policies.

Make sure to read the
[introduction on entitlement management](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/index.md)
first.

[See more information about role assignments](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/integration-guide/role-assignment/index.md).

## Roles

Roles represent entitlements from the managed systems, but expressed in a language understandable by
non-technical people.

A single role is meant to represent one entitlement from a managed system, by acting as a label,
thus allowing better organization and readability.

A composite role is meant to group several single roles into a meaningful, business-themed
entitlement package.

In this way, the role model can be seen as a
[Role-Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) (RBAC).

## Assignment Rules

An
[assignment rule](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/automate-role-assignment/index.md)
gives an entitlement to a user, usually based on (at least) one criterion from the user's data.
Assignment rules are:

- single role rules which assign single roles;
- composite role rules which assign composite roles;
- resource type rules which assign resources, usually accounts, of specific types.

The identity criteria that trigger the rules are named dimensions.

In this way, the role model can also be seen as an
[Attribute-Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)
(ABAC) model.

Usercube gives users access to given resources in the managed systems, based on roles and rules, but
it does not override the managed systems' authorization mechanisms.

## Enforcement of the Assignment Policy

The company's policy for entitlement assignment is enforced by Usercube with the the computation of
the role model, through the
[`ComputeRoleModelTask`](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/computerolemodeltask/index.md).
It applies all the configured rules, thus:

- helping build a catalog of all available entitlements in the managed systems, see
  [role naming conventions](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/index.md);
- helping build the rules that define the assignment policy, i.e. the expected entitlement
  assignments for all users, see the
  [role mining](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/role-mining/index.md);
- automating entitlement assignment, see
  [assignment rules](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/automate-role-assignment/index.md);
- generating the provisioning orders that enable writing to the managed systems, see
  [provisioning rules](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/index.md);
- detecting assignments in the managed systems that do not comply with the policy, see the
  [review of non-conforming assignments](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/user-guide/administrate/non-conforming-assignment-review/index.md).
