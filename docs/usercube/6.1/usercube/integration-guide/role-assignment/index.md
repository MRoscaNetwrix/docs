# Role Assignment

Once the role model is established, role assignment can be performed, i.e. missing or non-conforming
assignments can be detected in order to give users the appropriate access rights.

Be sure to read first the
[documentation about the role model](/docs/usercube/6.1/usercube/integration-guide/role-model/index.md).
