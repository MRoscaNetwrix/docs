# Entitlement Management

Managing identities' entitlements requires managing entitlements and assigning them to identities.
This page is about the role model.

## Role Model Overview

A managed system's entitlements can have many forms. They authorize identities to access certain
data on a given system, or a physical location.

> For example, entitlements in the Active Directory are usually group memberships. For example, to
> have administrator rights in the Iris application, a user must be part of the members of the group
> `SG_APP_IT/Development/Iris/Administrator`.

Identity ManagerÂ is designed to help establish an exhaustive and reliable catalog of the
entitlements available in the managed systems, and assign the right entitlements to the right users.

![Role Catalog and Users](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/entitlements_rolecatalogusers.webp)

Thus, the role model contains:

- the entitlements, as roles, for all managed systems;
- the rules that trigger the assignment of entitlements to identities, and more broadly manage the
  systems' resources. Some of them act as link between Identity Manager's roles and the systems'
  accounts and permissions. Some of them are linked to, and thus apply only to, specific resource
  types.

The role model is a subset of a policy that also includes [Governance](../governance/index.md) data
such as risk definition. So, at a higher level, distinct policies can be used to implement distinct
behaviors.

## A Role Catalog

Identity Manager intends to represent IGA-related access right mechanisms by a
[role-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) model. The goal of the role
catalog is contain an exhaustive list of entitlements from all managed systems.

Entitlements from the managed systems are modeled by roles. For each entitlement, NETWRIX advises
creating a single role, with an easily understandable name, more functional than technical, so that
everyone knows what the role is for.

![Single Roles](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/singlerolescatalog_schemarole.webp)

Each individual entitlement should usually be modeled by a single role, and single roles can be
grouped together into composite roles to be closer to real job positions.

## A Rule Set

Roles alone are not enough to give identities the systems' technical entitlements. We need rules to
have Identity Manager write users' entitlements in the managed systems. Rules are further used to
automatically assign roles to users, or to categorize users and accounts, etc.

### Provisioning rules

Just like identities, accounts are represented in Identity Manager by an
[ Identity Management ](../identity-management/index.md) entity-relationship model. So Identity
Manager manages entitlements as resources' attribute values.

> For example, giving specific Active Directory permissions to a new user means not only creating a
> new AD account, but also setting values for certain account properties like `cn`,
> `sAMaccountName`, `userAccountControl` or `dn`, etc.

Provisioning rules write the actual entitlements to the managed systems, most often based on users'
roles.

> For example, to give an AD entitlement to a user, we usually need to give them a group membership.
> Thus, we should have a rule that, when a user is assigned a specific role, adds the user to the
> member list of a specific AD group.

![Provisioning Rules](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/entitlements_provisioningrules.webp)

Even when a role is manually assigned, provisioning rules will determine which account (and
permission groups) are given as entitlements.

Identity Manager's provisioning rules are:

- scalar rules to compute simple string properties;
- navigation rules and query rules to compute properties that act as foreign keys in a database;
- resource type rules to automatically create resources.

### Assignment rules

While the role catalog and provisioning rules are together enough to manually give users their
access rights, we often want Identity Manager to do this automatically. Assignment rules
automatically assign roles to identities based on specific criteria.

> For example, we can choose to assign the role `Benefits Manager - FR` to any user whose job title
> is benefits manager and whose location is in France.

![Assignment Rules](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/entitlements_assignmentrules.webp)

Once all assignment rules are created, Identity Manager is able to spot existing assignments that
are not supported by any rule, marking them as non-conforming.

Identity Manager's assignment rules are:

- single role rules and composite role rules to assign single and composite roles;
- resource type rules to assign accounts.

### Categorization rules

Different resources can be managed through different rules, by being part of different resource
types. So a resource type is a group a resources that have the same IGA-related purposes.
Categorization rules categorize resources into resource types and link identities to the accounts
they own.

> For example, we might need to differentiate AD's standard accounts from administration accounts.
> This way, we can configure different email addresses for privileged accounts, for example
> [adm.john.smith@contoso.com](mailto:adm.john.smith@contoso.com). We can also add more approval
> steps in the workflows related to privileged accounts, for more security than for standard
> accounts.

![Categorization Rules](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/entitlements_categorizationrules.webp)

Identity Manager's categorization rules are:

- correlation rules to link identities to the accounts they own;
- classification rules to categorize resources into resource types.

### More rules

Identity Manager provides more kinds of rules for optimization purposes, for example role naming
conventions to help build the role catalog by generating roles and navigation rules based on the
entitlements' names, or automation rules to help with governance by automating the review of the
assignments that do not comply with the configured rules.

### Dimensions

Rules can be triggered based on users' assigned roles, but also based on user data.

The [ Identity Management ](../identity-management/index.md) model can be refined by configuring
dimensions: criteria from among resources'
[attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control) that will trigger the
application of the rules. Then Identity Manager applies the rule for any resource whose value for a
given attribute matches the reference value specified in the rule.

> For example, a user can be assigned the role `Benefits Manager - FR` only if their job title is
> benefits manager and their location is in France. In this case, users' attributes "job title" and
> "location" are the dimensions that trigger the assignment rule.

In a nutshell, dimensions determine who should be assigned the entitlements.

Identity Manager's name and logo are based on this dimension concept: entitlement assignment is
governed by users' attributes defined as dimensions. Let's schematize users around these dimensions:

- The schema for this with one dimension would be a line with all available values for the
  dimension, and identities are distributed along the line.
- The schema with two dimensions would be a table, a square.
- The schema with three dimensions would be a 3D cube. And you can imagine 4D or 5D hypercubes, etc.
