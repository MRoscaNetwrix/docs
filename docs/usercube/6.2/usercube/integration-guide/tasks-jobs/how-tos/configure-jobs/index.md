# Configure Jobs

This guide shows how to define the permissions for creating and using jobs thanks to scaffoldings.

There are two important jobs in Identity Manager. The
[ Set up Complete Synchronization ](../jobdaily/index.md) and the
[ Set Up Incremental Synchronization ](../jobfast/index.md). This two Job Synchronize and fill are
using to Synchronize and fill Connectors.

## Job Scaffoldings

There are six scaffoldings in Identity Manager to automatically create jobs in the configuration:

- A job for all connectors on an Agent
  ([Create Agent Synchro Complete](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/jobs/createagentsynchrocomplete/index.md)/[Create Agent Synchro Incremental](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/jobs/createagentsynchroincremental/index.md)
  mode).
- A job for a specific connector
  ([Create Connector Synchro Complete](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/jobs/createconnectorsynchrocomplete/index.md)/[Create Agent Synchro Incremental](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/jobs/createagentsynchroincremental/index.md)
  mode).
- [Create Initialization Job](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/jobs/createinitializationjob/index.md)
- [Create Access Certification Job](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/jobs/createaccesscertificationjob/index.md)
