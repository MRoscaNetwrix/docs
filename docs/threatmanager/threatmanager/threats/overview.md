# Type of Threats

Netwrix Threat Manager by default provides some pre-configured threats and users can create custom threats using the Custom option or through the Create Threat option on the Investigation page. The pre-defined and custom threats are listed in the Threat box. Threats that are crossed out are disabled threats.

The Threats list divides the threats into the following sections:

- [Active Directory Threats](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/threats/activedirectory.md)
- [Entra ID Threats](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/threats/entraid.md)
- [File System Threats](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/threats/filesystem.md)
- [General Threats](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/threats/general.md)
- [Custom Threats](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/threats/custom.md)

Select a threat from the list to display the threat's configuration options to the right of the Threats box.
