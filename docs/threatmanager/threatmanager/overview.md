# Netwrix Threat Manager v3.0

Threat Manager detects and responds to abnormal behavior and advanced attacks against Active
Directory and File Systems with unprecedented accuracy and speed. Threat Manager provides
programmatic and automated response options when threats are identified. In addition to an extensive
catalog of preconfigured response actions, Threat Manager can be configured to integrate with you
own business processes using integrated PowerShell or webhook facilities.

Threat Manager can also deliver threat data to administrators in their preferred applications,
including Microsoft Teams, Slack, ServiceNow, and a wide variety of SIEM platforms.

## Administration

Organizations of virtually any size find it to be impossible, even counterproductive, to evaluate
the substantial amount of file access events and Active Directory events occurring within their
environments on any given day. To overcome this challenge and achieve proper visibility into this
otherwise significant blind spot in an organization's cyber security program, Threat ManagerÂ®
provides built-in threat analytics to highlight the most unusual behaviors that occur within an
organization each day. Threat Manager also provides a method to deep dive into activity data using a
series of customizable filters to discover threats unique to their organization.
