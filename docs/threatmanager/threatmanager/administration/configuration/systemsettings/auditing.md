The Audit History table displays the following information:

- Log Level – The relative impact of the action. This feature is auto-assigned by the application.
- Log Type – The overall type of activity source of the change:

  - Audit – User-performed action
  - System – Change made by the application
  - Security – Log into the console
- Time Stamp – The date timestamp for when the changed occurred
- Description – A summary of the event that occurred
- User Name – The name of the user account that performed the audit event
- IP Address – The IP address for the user's client machine
- Category – The general categorization of the operation that was performed
- Sub-Category – The specific category of the operation
- Status – Indicates whether the event was completed successfully or failed
- Resource – Where applicable, identifies the related resource that was changed or accessed

The table is designed to display 10 records at a time, by default. However, you can set this to 50, 100, or 1,000 rows with the drop-down menu above the right corner of the table. There is a search box above the left corner of the table. Page navigation buttons are below the table. You can also export the data from the current page using the __Export CSV__ button.
