# Local Host Target Actions

The following actions target the Threat Manager server.

## PowerShell Script

The PowerShell Script action executes a specified PowerShell script. This action can be used to build a custom threat response, using PowerShell, to handle scenarios not covered by other preconfigured action steps.

- PowerShell Script – Select the PowerShell script to execute. By default, the PowerShell script includes a comment section which includes Threat Manager threat variables that can be used in PowerShell script action steps.
- Credential – Select a credential profile using the drop-down list. This will provide the PowerShell action step with a PowerShell credential object, based upon the Threat Manager credential specified for use in the script. For example:

  $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Computer01" -Credential $Credential

  Invoke-Command -Session $Session -ScriptBlock {Write-Host "Hello World"}
