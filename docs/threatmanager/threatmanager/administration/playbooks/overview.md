# Playbooks

The first step in designating steps to run in response to a threat is to add a playbook. A playbook is used to tie a threat or "trigger type" to the desired step(s) to take in response to that threat. A threat response can be assigned to a playbook on the [Threat Detection Page](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/administration/configuration/threatdetection.md). Once a playbook has been created, steps that specify the desired action for the threat response are then added.

___RECOMMENDED:___ Execute playbooks in a test environment and review the results prior to executing them in the production environment.

When testing or just getting started with playbooks in Threat Manager, trigger playbooks manually instead of automatically. Once the playbooks have been manually tested and you have familiarity with Threat Manager threats and threat responses, automatic triggering of playbooks can be enabled.

## Add a Playbook

Follow the steps to add a playbook.

![threatresponse](/img/product_docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/administration/configuration/threatresponse.webp)

__Step 1 –__ In the Threat Response box, click New Playbook. A new playbook called "My Playbook 1" is created. As additional Playbooks are added, sequential numbers are appended to My Playbook.

It is recommend to change the name of the playbook immediately after creation for organizational purposes.

__Step 2 –__ Select the newly-created playbook from the Playbooks tab and click the Edit button. Rename My Playbook with the desired name and optionally enter a description for the playbook in the Description field.

__Step 3 –__ Configure the Playbook using the configuration tabs.

__Step 4 –__ Click the Save button.

The new playbook now has the desired name and steps can be added to the playbook. See the [Actions Tab](#Actions-Tab) topic for additional information.

## Configure a Playbook

Playbooks are configured using the tabs on the Threat Response page.

![playbooktabs](/img/product_docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/administration/playbooks/playbooktabs.webp)

The Threat Response page contains the following configuration tabs:

- [General Tab](#General-Tab)
- [Actions Tab](#Actions-Tab)
- [Follow-Up Tab](#Follow-Up-Tab)
- [Logs Tab](#Logs-Tab)

### General Tab

The General Tab contains the Allowed Threats box which allows customization of which threats are applicable for the selected playbook.

![generaltab](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/policies/generaltab.webp)

The General tab has the following configuration options:

- Allowed for all threat response – Allows customization of which threats are applicable for this playbook. (All threats are allowed by default). If a threat is excluded from Allowed Threats, it will not be available to run ad hoc on the Threat Details page nor available for automated threat response.
- Send Email on Execution of Playbook – An email notification will be sent after the playbook has been executed.
- Search Threats – Select the threats that are allowed to be used as a threat response for this playbook from the drop-down list.

### Actions Tab

Once a playbook is created or imported, add steps to the playbook using the Actions tab. Steps are actions that are taken in response to a threat. See the [Preconfigured Actions](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/administration/configuration/threatresponse.md#preconfigured-actions) topic for additional information.

Follow the instructions to add steps to a Playbook.

- Display Name – The desired name for the step
- Action Type – The type of action to take for the threat response. Select the desired action from the drop-down list. Additional configuration information is required depending upon the type of action selected. See the [Action Configuration for Playbook Steps](/docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/administration/playbooks/action/overview.md) topic for additional information.
- Continue on Error – Select this checkbox to execute the next step if the current step fails

__Step 4 –__ Click Add to add the step to the playbook.

The step is added to the playbook.

### Follow-Up Tab

Follow-Up Playbooks can be configured on the Follow-Up tab. Follow-Up playbooks allow additional playbooks to run once the playbook has completed. This allows a (Undefined variable: SD.Product Short Name) administrator to sequence a series of playbooks together as part of a threat response.

![followuptab](/img/product_docs/threatmanager/threatmanager/administration/playbooks/followuptab.webp)

The Follow-Up tab has the following configuration options:

- Send Email on Follow-up – Send an email notification when a follow-up playbook runs
- On Fail – If the current playbook fails, run the selected playbook from the drop-down list
- On Success – If the current playbook runs successfully, run the selected playbook from the drop-down list

Click __Save__ to save the configured settings.

### Logs Tab

Click the Logs tab to access the Playbook Execution History table. The table lists all playbook executions and also provides the ability to search the table.
