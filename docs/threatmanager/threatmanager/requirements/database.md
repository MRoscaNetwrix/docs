__NOTE:__ Use this information when the database server is separate from the application server.

The Windows server can be physical or virtual. The following Windows server operating systems are supported:

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016

Additionally the server must meet these requirements:

- US English language installation

Additional Server Requirements

The following are additional requirements for the database server:

- .NETÂ 8.0.11
- .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.11
- ASP.NET Core 8.0.11
- VC++ redist v14.28.29914

Additional Considerations

The following considerations must be accommodated for:

- When running antivirus scans against the PostgreSQL v14 database, the PostgreSQL data folder must be excluded from the scans in order to prevent database complications.
- For performance reasons, disable Windows File Indexing on the drive containing the Threat Manager database.
- Disk Defragmentation jobs should never be performed on the drive containing Threat Manager PostgreSQL database. This can cause operational issues with the PostgreSQL database.
