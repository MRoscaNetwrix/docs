# Application Server Requirements

**CAUTION:** Netwrix Threat Manager cannot be installed on the same server as Netwrix Threat Manager
Reporting Module.

The Windows server can be physical or virtual. The following Windows server operating systems are
supported:

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016

Additionally the server must meet these requirements:

- US English language installation

RAM, CPU, and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the total number of daily events sent to Threat Manager. It is suggested to
use the total events for a peak day of the week, by activity.

| Environment      | Enterprise | Extra Large | Large  | Medium | Small | Extra Small |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| Daily Events     | 130 M      | 90 M        | 45 M   | 21 M   | 4.5 M | 875 K       |
| RAM              | 64 GB      | 64 GB       | 32 GB  | 32 GB  | 32 GB | 16 GB       |
| Cores            | 24         | 12          | 8      | 8      | 4     | 4           |
| Daily Disk Usage | 300 GB     | 170 GB      | 120 GB | 40 GB  | 10 GB | 5 GB        |
| Total Disk Space | 4 TB       | 3 TB        | 2 TB   | 1 TB   | 1 TB  | 1 TB        |
| IOPS             | 8,000      | 5,000       | 3,000  | 2,000  | 1,000 | 500         |

**NOTE:** All values are based upon a seven day event retention period in Threat Manager.

Daily events to be monitored by Threat Manager can typically be discovered by using Netwrix Threat
Prevention or Netwrix Activity Monitor. When planning a deployment where there is currently no
Netwrix agent deployed, it can be more difficult to plan for scale. However, the following are
estimations based on organization size can be used:

- For fewer than 1,000 active users

    - Generally assume 21 million daily events (Medium environment)

- For 1,000-10,000 active users

    - Generally assume 45 million daily events (Large environment)

- For more than 10,000 active users

    - Generally assume at minimum 100 million daily events (Extra Large-Enterprise environment)

Minimum hardware requirements:

- 8 GB RAM
- 4 CPU Cores

- 150 GB Disk Space

Additional Server Requirements

The following are additional requirements for the application server:

- .NET 8.0.11
- .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.11
- ASP.NET Core 8.0.11
- VC++ redist v14.28.29914
- Python v3.10.8x64

Additional Considerations when Database is on the Application Server

The following considerations must be accommodated for:

- When running antivirus scans against the PostgreSQL v14 database, the PostgreSQL data folder must
  be excluded from the scans in order to prevent database complications.
- For performance reasons, disable Windows File Indexing on the drive containing the Threat Manager
  database.
- Disk Defragmentation jobs should never be performed on the drive containing Threat Manager
  PostgreSQL database. This can cause operational issues with the PostgreSQL database.

Permissions for Installation and Application Use

The following permissions are required to install and use the application:

- Membership in the local Administrators group

## Virtual Environment Recommendations

While physical machines are always preferred, we fully support the use of virtual machines. This
section contains special considerations when leveraging virtualization.

- VMWare® ESX® – If using ESX, the following specifications are recommended:

    - ESX 4.0 / ESXi™ 4.1 or higher
    - Virtual Hardware 7 or higher
    - All Virtual Machines installed on the same datacenter / rack

- Virtual Storage Consideration

    - In the server requirements, when separate disks are required for the servers, that should
      translate to separate data stores on the VM host machine.
