# Type of Threats

Netwrix Threat Manager by default provides some pre-configured threats and users can create custom
threats using the Custom option or through the Create Threat option on the Investigation page. The
pre-defined and custom threats are listed in the Threat box. Threats that are crossed out are
disabled threats.

The Threats list divides the threats into the following sections:

- [Active Directory Threats](activedirectory.md)
- [Entra ID Threats](entraid.md)
- [File System Threats](filesystem.md)
- [General Threats](general.md)
- [Custom Threats](custom.md)

Select a threat from the list to display the threat's configuration options to the right of the
Threats box.
