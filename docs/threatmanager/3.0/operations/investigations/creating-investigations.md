# New Investigation Page

The New Investigation page within the Investigations interface enables you to run queries on
available data with desired filters for a specific timeframe.

![Investigations interface on the New Investigation page](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/reportingmodule/interface.webp)

To generate a new investigation report, configure the filters as desired and set the timeframe. See
the [Filters Section](/docs/threatmanager/3.0/operations/investigations/managing-investigations.md) topic for additional information.

Then click **Run Query**. The report data is displayed in the sections below the Filters section.
See the [Investigation Reports](/docs/threatmanager/3.0/operations/investigations/reports.md) topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** If you run a query without applying filters, the report sections display all activity by
all users for the designated timeframe, which is set by default to _Last Hour_.

The report generated by a New Investigation can be exported. The Schedule Export option is not
available from the New Investigation page. See the [Export Report](/docs/threatmanager/3.0/operations/investigations/managing-investigations.md) topic for
additional information.

The Save option allows you to save your configured filters to run the investigation again later.

## Save an Investigation

To retain filter configuration after running a query and confirming the desired report data is
displayed, follow the steps to save an investigation.

**NOTE:** This option is available only to users with the Administrator or the Response Managers
roles.

**Step 1 –** On the New Investigation page, click **Save** in the upper right corner. The Save
Investigation window opens.

**Step 2 –** Enter a unique, descriptive name for this investigation in the **Name** field.

**Step 3 –** Enter a report description in the **Description** field.

**Step 4 –** From the Folder drop-down menu, select the location where the investigation will be
saved. The My Investigations folder is the default for custom investigations.

**Step 5 –** Select a user role from the Owner drop-down menu. All users assigned this role would
own this investigation and they will be able to modify the report.

**Step 6 –** In the Access box, type to search the user role you want to give access of this
investigation. A list of user roles matching the search string is displayed. Select a single or
multiple user roles. All users belonging to the selected role(s) can view the report.

**Step 7 –** Click **Save**. The Save Investigation window closes.

The investigation is saved to the selected folder, and the folder expands in the navigation pane to
display the saved item. Users can open this folder from the navigation pane to access the
investigation. They can run the investigation, schedule exports, or add subscriptions.

See the [Investigation Options](/docs/threatmanager/3.0/operations/investigations/managing-investigations.md) topic for additional information.

# Investigations Interface

The Investigation interface allows administrators to investigate all data available to the
application through a series of customizable filters. These investigations can be saved so they can
be run ad hoc at a later time. Investigations can also be "saved as a threat" which enables
investigation criteria to function as a threat detection mechanism that will be monitored by Threat
Manager like out-of-the-box threats.

Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the Investigations interface.
