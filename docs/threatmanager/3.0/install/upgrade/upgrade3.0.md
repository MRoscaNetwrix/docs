**NOTE:** If you have any antivirus or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software installed on
your machine, make sure you have excluded all of the files from the following directories from all
antivirus scans:

- \Program Files\Stealthbits\PostgreSQL14
- \ProgramData\Stealthbits\PostgreSQL14
- \Program Files\Stealthbits\StealthDEFEND

PostgreSQL may fail to start or behave unexpectedly when monitored by any tool.

## Install Threat Manager 3.0

**Step 1 –** Click the Netwrix Threat Manager **Setup** button on the Netwrix Threat Manager setup
window. The following message displays:

**Step 6 –** On the database page, ensure the host and port are set correctly.

**NOTE:** If installing on the same server where the PostgreSQL database application was installed,
this information will be accurate by default. The default database name is stealthdefend; however,
it can be modified as desired.

**Step 7 –** Click **Test** to validate the connection information.

**Step 8 –** After successful validation, click **Next**.

checkbox if you do not want the installer to automatically create these rules, because you have
already created them. Click **Next**.
