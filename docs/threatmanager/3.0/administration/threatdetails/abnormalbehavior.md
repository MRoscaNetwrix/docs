# Abnormal Behavior Threat Details

The Threat Details page for abnormal behavior has a different layout and provides different
information than the Threat Details page for other threat types. It displays information about user
behaviors that deviate from the user's normal behavioral profile. Abnormal behavior detection begins
when a user has been active for a minimum of 30 days, with up to 120 days of activity used to
establish the baseline behavior for a user.

The top of the page shows the number of each of the following:

- Hosts

The Abnormality Summary box gives a general description of the abnormal behavior and when it was

activity detected for the user before and after the abnormality occurred.
