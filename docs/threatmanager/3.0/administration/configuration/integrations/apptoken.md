# App Tokens Page

The App Tokens page provides the ability to generate and manage the app tokens needed to send data
to Threat Manager. An app token is used by Threat Manager and/or the Activity Monitor to push Active
Directory activity data into the Threat Manager database. An app token is used by Access Analyzer to
push a list of files containing sensitive data into the Threat Manager database.

It is necessary to generate an app token for each product integration. The App Tokens table displays
the following information for each generated app token:

- Name – Name of the app token

  for the generated app token.
