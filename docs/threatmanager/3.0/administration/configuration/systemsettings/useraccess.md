# User Access Page

The User Access page within the System Settings interface displays users and groups with their
assigned roles for console access.

![System Settings interface on the User Access page](/images/threatmanager/3.0/administration/configuration/systemsettings/page.webp)

Roles are assigned by the following methods:

- Group Membership – Members of the group will be given the role assigned

    :::note
    If a user is a member of multiple assigned groups, the group with the highest level of
    privilege is assigned
    :::


- Direct User Assignment – Assigns a role directly to a user

    :::note
    If a user is assigned a role directly, it takes priority over any group membership
    roles that have been assigned
    :::


The User Access page includes the following sections:

- Users & Groups – It provides the ability to allow or deny console access and configure
  authentication types for users and groups. See the Users & Groups topic for additional
  information.
- Settings – It provides the ability to customize the user login page and configure the token
  expiration time for authenticated users. See the Settings topic for additional information.

## Users & Groups

The Users & Groups section provides the ability to allow or deny console access and configure
authentication types for users and groups.

![Users and Groups section of the User Access page](/images/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/systemsettings/usersgroups.webp)

The table displays the following information:

- Access rule type – Indicates the access type as _Allow_, which enables console access, or _Deny_,
  which disables console access

    :::note
    Disabling a user or group disables that level of access. It does not block the user or
    group from logging into the console if they have access through another role assignment.
    :::


- Login name – The NTStyle domain name for the user or group account
- Display name – The display name for the user or group account
- Domain Name – Name of the domain. This may be either the domain DNS name or domain controller
  hostname. For the built-in ADMIN account, the domain is DEFEND Admin.
- Role – The role assigned to the user or group for accessing this application. See the Roles
  Defined topic for additional information.
- Authentication Type – Type of MFA authentication assigned to the user or group. See the
  Authentication Types Defined topic for additional information.

    - Edit icon – Allows you to edit the columns in the selected row by enabling drop-down menus.
      The edit icon changes to a save icon while in edit mode. See the Edit Console Access topic for
      additional information.
    - Trash icon – Opens a Warning window to confirm the action of deleting the user or group.
      Removing a user or group removes console access for it.. Note that the builtin "ADMIN" account
      cannot have its access removed until an account besides the builtin "ADMIN" is granted
      administrative access to the console.
    - Reset MFA button – Forces the user or every user in the group to reconfigure MFA on the next
      login. This option is only available if an MFA authentication type is applied to the user or
      group.
    - Change Password icon – Only available for the built-in ADMIN account. This icon opens the Edit
      password for build-in admin window. See the Edit Built-in Admin Password topic for additional
