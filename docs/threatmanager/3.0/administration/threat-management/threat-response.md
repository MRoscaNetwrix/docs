# Threat Response Page

The Threat Response page provides the ability to create playbooks and add steps which contain
actions that can be executed in response to detected threats. Threat Manager provides preconfigured
actions for different targets.

Playbooks are a collection of steps that run sequentially in response to a threat. Each step
contains an action that is designated for the threat response. These steps typically integrate with
existing resources in the organization such as email and helpdesk platforms, Active Directory, file
systems, and custom PowerShell scripts. Playbooks can be executed automatically or ad-hoc by a
Threat Manager Administrator when a threat is detected.

**NOTE:** Custom playbooks can be created using the PowerShell Script action. However, this feature
requires advanced scripting knowledge.
