# Investigations Interface

The Investigation interface allows administrators to investigate all data available to the
application through a series of customizable filters. These investigations can be saved so they can
be run ad hoc at a later time. Investigations can also be "saved as a threat" which enables
investigation criteria to function as a threat detection mechanism that will be monitored by Threat
Manager like out-of-the-box threats.

Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the Investigations interface.
