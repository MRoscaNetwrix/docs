  associated reviews. For a **single** review the [Membership](/docs/platgfornetsuite/uar/uar_additional_reviewer/add_reviewer_membership_reviews.md)
  or [Permission ](/docs/platgfornetsuite/uar/uar_owner/owner_permission_reviews.md)**Review** tab is opened. Reviews can
  also be opened via links in dashboard or email **Notifications**.
