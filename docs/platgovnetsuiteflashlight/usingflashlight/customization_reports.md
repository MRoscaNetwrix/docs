# Customization Reports

Flashlight provides a set of useful reports to help you ensure that your account customizations
follow NetSuite best practices. It is recommended to regular review these reports and take
corrective action so that your customizations are aligned with NetSuite best practices.

The following reports can be accessed from Flashlight main menu under the **Customizations** menu:

- Customizations with Poor Script Ids
- Customizations with Missing Descriptions
- Customizations with Missing Active Owner
- Fields with Missing Help
- Deleted Customizations

## Customizations with Poor Script Ids

It is a best practice to use Script IDs that are unique, short, and descriptive. Users often set
Script IDs that do follow these best practices, or they do not set any Script IDs which causes
NetSuite to apply a default value.

This report provides a list of all customizations in the system that have Script IDs not aligned
with NetSuite's best practices.

## Customizations with Missing Descriptions

Each object in NetSuite should have a Description that explains what the object is and how it is
used in the system. This report provides a list of all customizations in your account that have no
description.

the organization. If an inactive employee is the owner of a field or record in the system, it could
be harmful for your account. This report displays a list of all customizations in the system that
currently have inactive employees as owners.

understand what the field does and how to use it. This report displays a list of all the fields in
