# Spider Spins and Does Not Finish

If you kick off a spider and the gears on the page spin for more than an hour, there are two likely
causes:

- You closed the web browser tab where the spider was running, or switched roles before the gears
  stopped spinning. In this case, restart the spider.
- There is an issue with the **IP Restriction**. Contact Strongpoint support for assistance in
  configuring your account.

# Stop Scripts

You can stop the Spider scripts at any point during the spider process:

Open **Flashlight** > **Support** > **Stop Scripts**

This stops the next execution of the scheduled scripts.
