# Understanding the Customization Record

A Flashlight Customization Record contains all the information about a given customization in one
place, giving you everything you need to know about your objects at your fingertips. Customization
Records are created and maintained by Flashlight's spider as it documents your account. The records
enable us to search customizations and to attach them to processes.

Here is an example Customization Record for a Scheduled Script:

#### Summary

The top section summarizes the key data about the Object:
