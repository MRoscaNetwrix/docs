# Using the Strongpoint SQL Library

The SQL Library is a powerful tool to help you locate formulas used across the Saved Searches in your account. An example is to locate a formula to reuse it in another search.

To access the SQL Library:

Open __Flashlight__ > __Tools__ > __SQL Library__

![SQL Library](/img/product_docs/strongpointnetsuiteflashlight/using_flashlight/sql_library_800x251.webp)

This report displays a list of all formulas used in Saved Searches. The report contains the following information:

- __Internal ID__: internal id of the Saved Search.
- __Name__: name of the Saved Search.
- __Parent__: parent of the Saved Search (for example, ScheduleScripts, Workflows, ClientScripts).
- __Search Formulas__: all formulas from the Saved Search criteria and results.
- __Go To Record__: link to the specific Saved Search record.
