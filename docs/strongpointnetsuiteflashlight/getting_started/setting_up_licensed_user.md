# Setting up a Licensed User

When you first install NetSuite, you need to create a licensed user who has full access to Flashlight. You can use this same procedure to switch permissions to an existing user.

1. Open __Flashlight__ > __Support__ > __Users & License Manager__.
2. Click __Edit__.

3. Select __New Licensed User__.

NOTE: If you are changing permission from one user to another, select __Edit__ by the existing __User__ name.

4. Select your name from the __User__ list and __Full__ permission as the __License Type__.
