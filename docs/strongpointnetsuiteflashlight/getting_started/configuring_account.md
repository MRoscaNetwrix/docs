# Configuring your Account

Before you can start documenting your system, you need to apply a configuration change to your account that updates the number of rows in list segments. The following steps describe how to accomplish this configuration:

1. Hover over the __Home__ icon, and click __Set Preferences__ from the drop down menu.
2. Scroll down to the __Optimizing NetSuite__ section.
3. Set __Number of Rows in List Segments__ to _1000_  
   If the field is grayed and cannot be edited, refer to the troubleshooting article [List Segments Field Cannot be Edited](/docs/strongpointnetsuiteflashlight/troubleshooting/list_segments_not_editable.md).

You are now ready to use Flashlight to document your account.
