# Target Exchange Servers Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

The Access Analyzer for Exchange Solution is compatible with the following Exchange Server versions as targets:

* Exchange 2019 (Limited)
* Exchange 2016 (Limited)
* Exchange 2013
* Exchange 2010 (Limited)

See the [Exchange Support and Permissions Explained](../Solutions/Exchange/Support "Exchange Support and Permissions Explained") topic for details on the type of auditing supported by data collector and by job group.

Domain Controller Requirements

The following are requirements for the Exchange servers to be scanned:

* Enable Remote PowerShell on one Client Access Server (CAS)
* Enable Windows Authentication for the PowerShell Virtual Directory on the same CAS
* .NET Framework 4.5+ installed on all Exchange servers to be targeted
* WINRM Service installed on all Exchange servers to be targeted as a back up in the event of a remote PowerShell failure
* Within the Access Analyzer Console, the global **Settings > Exchange** node must be configured

  **NOTE:** For Exchange 2013, 2016, and 2019 â€“ If the global Settings have been configured for "MAPI over HTTP," then an actual CAS server name was supplied and will be used by the ExchangePS Data Collector. If the global Settings have been configured for "MAPI over HTTPS," then the global Settings will have a web address instead of an actual server. Therefore, each ExchangePS query requires the CAS server to be set as the specific server on the Category page. See the [ExchangePS Data Collector & Client Access Server](../../Solutions/Exchange/Recommended#_ExchangePS_Data_Collector_1 "ExchangePS Data Collector & Client Access Server") topic for a list of queries for which this would apply.

Data Collectors

This solution employs the following data collector to scan the target environment:

* [ADInventory Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/ADInventory/Overview "ADInventory Data Collector")
* [EWSMailbox Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/EWSMailbox/Overview "EWSMailbox Data Collector")
* [EWSPublicFolder Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/EWSPublicFolder/Overview "EWSPublicFolder Data Collector")
* [Exchange2K Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/Exchange2K/Overview "Exchange2K Data Collector")
* [ExchangeMailbox Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/ExchangeMailbox/Overview "ExchangeMailbox Data Collector")
* [ExchangeMetrics Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/ExchangeMetrics/Overview "ExchangeMetrics Data Collector")
* [ExchangePS Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/ExchangePS/Overview "ExchangePS Data Collector")
* [ExchangePublicFolder Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/ExchangePublicFolder/Overview "ExchangePublicFolder Data Collector")
* [SMARTLog Data Collector](../../Admin/DataCollector/SMARTLog/Overview "SMARTLog Data Collector")
