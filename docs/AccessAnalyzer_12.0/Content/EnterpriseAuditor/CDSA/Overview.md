# Credential & Data Security Assessment Overview

Proper data security begins with a strong foundation. The Credential & Data Security Assessment (CDSA) provides a deep-dive into the security of your structured and unstructured data, Active Directory, and Windows infrastructure.

The CDSA job depends upon several Access Analyzer solutions for data collection. See the [Requirements](../Requirements/Overview "Requirements") topic for installation and database requirements.

## Supporting Solutions

At a minimum the following solutions need to run prior to the CDSA job to provide the data used to generate the CDSA presentations:

* .Active Directory Inventory Solution

  * See the [.Active Directory Inventory Solution](../Solutions/ActiveDirectoryInventory/Overview ".Active Directory Inventory Solution") topic for additional information
* Active Directory Solution

  * See the [Active Directory Solution](../Solutions/ActiveDirectory/Overview "Active Directory Solution") topic for additional information
* Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution

  * See the [Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution](../Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Overview "Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution") topic for additional information
* File System Solution

  * See the [File System Solution](../Solutions/FileSystem/Overview "File System Solution") topic for additional information
* Windows Solution

  * See the [Windows Solution](../Solutions/Windows/Overview "Windows Solution") topic for additional information

The following additional solutions also provide data to the CDSA job:

* [Entra ID Solution](../Solutions/EntraID/Overview "Entra ID Solution")
* [AWS Solution](../Solutions/AWS/Overview "AWS Solution")
* [Box Solution](../Solutions/Box/Overview "Box Solution")
* [Dropbox Solution](../Solutions/Dropbox/Overview "Dropbox Solution")

* [SQL Job Group](../Solutions/Databases/SQL/Overview "SQL Solution")

Additionally, the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On also contributes to the CDSA presentations. See the [Sensitive Data Discovery](../SensitiveDataDiscovery/Overview "Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On") topic for additional information.
