**Step 4 –** Navigate to the Edit Query page. Click the **Parameters** tab on the right-hand side of the page to expand the Parameters window. See the [PowerShell: Edit Query](../../Admin/DataCollector/PowerShell/EditQuery "PowerShell: Edit Query") topic for additional information. Configure the following attributes as needed:

* $portNumber – The port number used to access the Oracle Database Server
* $fetchCount – The number of rows to process in a batch. Leave at default unless otherwise required.
* $Attributes – The list of attributes that will be scanned for during sensitive data scanning. Default values are MRN, SSN, Name, Date of Birth, Subscriber ID, Identity ID, and Account ID.

  * An attribute in the Attributes list will not be considered a match (in reporting and AIC) unless an attribute in the RequiredAttributes list is also found in the same file
* $RequiredAttributes – The list of attributes that need to be found in the document in order to trigger a match. The default values are SSN, MRN, and IdentityID.

  * An attribute in the Attributes list will not be considered a match (in reporting and AIC) unless an attribute in the RequiredAttributes list is also found in the same file
* $debugMode – When set to true, stores unhashed attribute values for troubleshooting purposes

**Step 5 –** Click **Next**. Continue to the **Sample server** page and click **Finish** to save changes. Click **Cancel** to exit the wizard without saving changes.

Repeat these steps for each query in the case that a non default port value is required. Once completed, the queries are ready to run.
