# 1.Groups Job Group

The 1.Groups Job Group provides a workflow to safely deprovision groups, as well as the ability to stamp security groups with what resources they are given access to.

![1.Groups Job Group in the Jobs Tree](../../../../../../../../static/images/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/Content/Resources/Images/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectory/Cleanup/GroupsJobTree.png "1.Groups Job Group in the Jobs Tree")

The jobs in the 1.Groups Job Group are:

* [1.Deprovision Job Group](Deprovision/Overview "1.Deprovision Job Group") – This job group provides a simple, automated workflow to deprovision stale groups

  * [AD\_DeprovisionGroups Job](Deprovision/AD_DeprovisionGroups "AD_DeprovisionGroups Job") – This job provides a simple automated workflow to deprovision stale groups
  * [AD\_DeprovisionGroups\_Status Job](Deprovision/AD_DeprovisionGroups_Status "AD_DeprovisionGroups_Status Job") – This job tracks and reports on the progress of the deprovisioning workflow
* [2.Group Stamping Job Group](Stamping/Overview "2.Group Stamping Job Group") – This job group updates the Notes attribute for all security groups to show where the group is provisioned inside the environment.

  * [AD\_GroupCleanup\_Permissions Job](Stamping/AD_GroupCleanup_Permissions "AD_GroupCleanup_Permissions Job") – This job reports on where security groups are being used to assign permissions. This can be used to prioritize remediation for groups that are rarely used.
  * [AD\_GroupStamping Job](Stamping/AD_GroupStamping "AD_GroupStamping Job") – This job replaces the Notes attribute for all security groups to show where the group is provisioned inside the environment. This overwrites the Notes field with data from Access Analyzer.

Workflow

**Step 1 –** Ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* The .Active Directory Inventory Job Group needs to be successfully run
* For the AD\_DeprovisionGroups Job, the target OU needs to be manually set in the Move Groups Action Task prior to executing the actions. See the [Action Tasks for the AD\_DepvisionGroups Job](Deprovision/AD_DeprovisionGroups#Action "Action Tasks for the AD_DepvisionGroups Job") topic for additional information.
* The AD\_DeprovisionGroups Job needs to be run prior to running the AD\_DeprovisionGroups\_Status Job

**Step 2 –** Schedule the 1.Groups Job Group to run as desired after the prerequisites have been satisfied.

**Step 3 –** Review the reports generated by the 1.Groups Job Group.
