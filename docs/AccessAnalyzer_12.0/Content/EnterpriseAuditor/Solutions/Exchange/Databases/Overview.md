The following comprise the 3. Databases Job Group:

* [0.Collection Job Group](Collection/Overview "0.Collection Job Group") – Comprised of data collection, analysis, and reports that focus on database sizing, growth, and trends
* [EX\_DBSizing Job](EX_DBSizing "EX_DBSizing Job") – Comprised of analyses and reports which provide information on current database sizes, growth statistics, and historical sizing information
* [EX\_DBTrending](EX_DBTrending "EX_DBTrending") – Creates trend projections for mailbox and public folder databases for the entire organization

The 3. Databases Job Group uses a MAPI-based data collector, Exchange2K. Therefore, it requires both Access Analyzer MAPI CDO and Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO to be installed on the Access Analyzer Console server. Once these have been installed, the **Settings** > **Exchange** node must be configured for proper connection to the Exchange server.

See the [Exchange](../../../Admin/Settings/Exchange "Exchange") topic for additional information.
