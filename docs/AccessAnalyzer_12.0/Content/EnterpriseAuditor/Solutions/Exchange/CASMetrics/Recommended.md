# Recommended Configurations for the 2. CAS Metrics Job Group

Dependencies

The following job groups need to be successfully run:

* .Active Directory Inventory Job Group
* .Entra ID Inventory Job Group

Targeted Hosts

The 0. Collection Job Group has been set to run against the following default dynamic host list:

* Exchange CAS Servers

The EX\_ASPolicies Job has been set to run against the following default dynamic host list:

* Exchange MB Servers

**NOTE:** Default dynamic host lists are populated from hosts in the Host Master Table which meet the host inventory criteria for the list. Ensure the appropriate host lists have been populated through host inventory results.

***RECOMMENDED:*** Modify hosts lists only in the 0. Collection Job Group or EX\_ASPolicies Job.

Connection Profile

A Connection Profile must be set directly on the EX\_IISLogs Job and the EX\_ASPolicies Job.

See the [Exchange Remote Connections Permissions](../../../Requirements/Solutions/Exchange/RemoteConnections "Exchange Remote Connections PermissionsExchange Remote Connections Permissions") topic for the EX\_IISLogs Job required permissions. See the [Exchange PowerShell Permissions](../../../Requirements/Solutions/Exchange/PowerShell "Exchange PowerShell Permissions") topic for the EX\_ASPolicies Job requirements.

See the [Connection](../../../Admin/Settings/Connection/Overview "Connection") topic for additional information.

Schedule Frequency

This job group has been designed to run daily one hour after the 1.HUB Metrics Job Group to process and collect the previous day’s message tracking logs.

***RECOMMENDED:*** Run this Job Group at 2:00 AM.

History Retention

History retention should not be enabled on this job group. History is kept through analysis tasks. Modify the following analysis tasks to customize the amount of history which is kept.

| Job Name | Analysis Task Name | Default History |

* **0. Collection** > **EX\_IISLogs** Job – **IIS Logs** Query
* **EX\_ASPolicies** Job – **Exchange Settings** Query

No other queries should be modified.

Analysis Configuration

The 2. CAS Metrics Job Group should be run with the default analysis configurations.

**CAUTION:** Most of these analysis tasks are preconfigured and should not be modified or deselected. There are some that are deselected by default, as they are for troubleshooting purposes.

* **ActiveSync** > **EX\_ActiveSync** Job – **07. SET HISTORY RETENTION** Analysis Task
* **Outlook Anywhere** > **EX\_RPCTraffic** Job – **05. SET HISTORY RETENTION** Analysis Task
* **Outlook Web Access** > **OWATraffic** Job – **05. SET HISTORY RETENTION** Analysis Task
