# Unix Data Collector

The Unix Data collector provides host inventory, software inventory, and logical volume inventory on UNIX & Linux platforms. The Unix Data Collector has been preconfigured within the Unix Solution. Both this data collector and the solution are available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the [Unix Solution](../../../Solutions/Unix/Overview "Unix Solution") topic for additional information.

Protocols

Ports

* TCP 22
* User configurable

Permissions

If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the [Least Privilege Model](../../../Requirements/Target/Unix#Least "Least Privilege Model") topic additional information.
