Properties can be checked individually, or the **Select All**and **Clear All** buttons can be used. All checked properties are gathered. Available properties vary based on the category selected. This information is not available within the standard reference tables. Instead, this information can be viewed in the table created by the query task, for example SA\_1-SPAA\_SystemScans\_Access table.
