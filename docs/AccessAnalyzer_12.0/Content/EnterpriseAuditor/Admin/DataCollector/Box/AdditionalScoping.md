Configure the scan depth level:

* Limit scanned depth to: [number] level – Select the checkbox and set the scan depth level to the desired depth. If this checkbox is not selected, then the entire Box environment will be scanned, according to the [Box: Exclusions Page](Exclusions "Box: Exclusions Page") settings. If the scoping depth is set to **0** then only root will be scanned. Each increment will add another level of depth from root level.
