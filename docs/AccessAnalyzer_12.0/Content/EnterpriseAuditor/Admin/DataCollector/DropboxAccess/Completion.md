Click **Finish** to save configuration changes. If no changes were made, it is a best practice to click **Cancel** to close the Dropbox Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard ensuring that no accidental clicks are saved.

*Remember,* if an Access Token was generated, use it as the credential within the Connection Profile. Then assign it to the job group or job which will be scanning the targeted Dropbox environment. See the [Custom Dropbox Connection Profile & Host List](ConfigureJob "Custom Dropbox Connection Profile & Host List") topic for additional information.
