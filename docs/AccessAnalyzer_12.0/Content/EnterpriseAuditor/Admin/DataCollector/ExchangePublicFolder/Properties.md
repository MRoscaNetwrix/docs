# ExchangePublicFolder:Â Properties

The Properties page is where properties that will be gathered are selected. It is a wizard page for all of the categories.

Properties can be selected individually or you can use the **Select All**, **Clear All**, or **Reset All** buttons. All selected properties will be gathered. The **Message Classes** button opens the Message classes filters window.

The wildcard (`*`) returns all message class filters. Enter the name of a class filter and click **Add** to add it to the list. **Delete** will remove the selected class filter from the list. The **Load defaults** option will restore the class filter default settings.
