The categories are:

* Calculate Group Size (Files Only) – Scans of disk space for the amount used by files in each folder location. This option scopes the query to files so that any information involving the folders that hold the files is not retrieved.
* File or Folder Properties – Scans the target host for specific attributes and properties associated with certain files and folders in the environment. This option is selected by default.
* File or Folder Permissions – Scans files or folders for permission settings and effective permission results for both users and groups
