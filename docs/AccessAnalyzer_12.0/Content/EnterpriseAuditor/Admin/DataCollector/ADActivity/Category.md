![Active Directory Activity DC wizard Category page](../../../../../../../static/images/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/Content/Resources/Images/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADActivity/Category.png "Active Directory Activity DC wizard Category page")

The ADActivity Data Collector Category page contains three query categories:

* Import From SAM – Import activity from a Netwrix Activity Monitor archive
* Import From Share – Import activity from a network share
* Remove Tables – Removes all tables and views from SQL Server database. This option is designed for troubleshooting. When this option is selected, the next wizard page is the Summary page. See the [Clear ADActivity Tables](ClearTables "Clear ADActivity Tables") topic for more information.
