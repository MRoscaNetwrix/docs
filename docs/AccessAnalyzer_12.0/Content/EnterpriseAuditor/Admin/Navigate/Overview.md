The primary sections of the Access Analyzer Console are:

* [Top Navigation](Top "Top Navigation") – Comprised of the Menu Bar and the Actions Bar
* [Navigation Pane](Pane "Navigation Pane") – Navigate through all of Access Analyzer’s major functions using the Navigation Pane. Selecting a node or sub-folder in the Navigation Pane will change what can be done in the Results Pane.
* [Results Pane](ResultsPane "Results Pane") – Displays various interfaces based on what is selected in the Navigation Pane or Activities Pane
* [Activities Pane](ActivitiesPane "Activities Pane") – Displays a list of activities which can be conducted within the currently selected console section

Access Analyzer Data Grids also have specific navigation options that enable users to filter, group, and search through data. See the [Data Grid Functionality](DataGrid "Data Grid Functionality") topic for additional information.
