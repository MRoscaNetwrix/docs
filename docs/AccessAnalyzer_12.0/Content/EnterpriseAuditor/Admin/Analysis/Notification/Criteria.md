# Notification: Criteria

Use the Notification Criteria page to specify criteria to trigger a notification.

![Notification Data Analysis Module wizard Criteria page](../../../../../../../static/images/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/Content/Resources/Images/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/Notification/Criteria.png "Notification Data Analysis Module wizard Criteria page")

The following options are available:

* No Criteria – Set no criteria to trigger a notification if any property changes. If selected, any row will trigger the notification.
* Simple Criteria – Select criteria to send a notification based on the value of a specific property or column in the database. The trigger can be if the property or column value is greater than, equal to, or less than the value provided.
* Advanced Criteria – Use the Filter Builder to create custom triggers when a value meets the defined conditions. See the [Advanced Search](../../Navigate/DataGrid#Advanced "Advanced Search") topic for additional information.
