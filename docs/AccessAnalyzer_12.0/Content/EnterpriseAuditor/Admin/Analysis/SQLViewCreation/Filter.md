Filters reduce the amount of data visible in a column imported to the resulting table or view. By default, when the filter page is blank, all the data within each column is included. Use the following options to add and remove filters:

* Edit – Opens the Filter window

  * See the [Advanced Search](../../Navigate/DataGrid#Advanced "Advanced Search") topic for additional information
* Clear – Clears any specified filters
