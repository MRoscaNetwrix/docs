# Importing False Positive Exclusion Filters

Create an import (TXT) file containing a list of file paths for the files to be excluded from Sensitive Data reports. The text file should have one file path per row. The import file needs to be scoped to a single solution and a criteria set.

Follow the steps to import a list of False Positive Exclusion Filter.
