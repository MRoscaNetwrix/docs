# Sensitive Data

The Sensitive Data node provides configuration options to manage sensitive data criteria and false positive exclusion filters. These settings require Sensitive Data Discovery to be licensed. See the [Sensitive Data Discovery](../../../SensitiveDataDiscovery/Overview "Sensitive Data Discovery") topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** Sensitive data exclusion filters can only be applied to the [File System Solution](../../../Solutions/FileSystem/Overview "File System Solution") and the [SharePoint Solution](../../../Solutions/SharePoint/Overview "SharePoint Solution").
