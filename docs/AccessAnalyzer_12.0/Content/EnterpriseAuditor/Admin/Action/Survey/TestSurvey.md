# Survey: Test Survey

Use this page to test a survey and verify proper configuration.

![Survey Action Module Wizard Test Survey page](../../../../../../../static/images/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/Content/Resources/Images/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Action/Survey/TestSurvey.png "Survey Action Module Wizard Test Survey page")

The configurable options are:

* Start test – Click to test your survey configuration
* Survey full test – Once the survey configuration test passes inspection, a full survey can be tested against a single user (for example, your own email account) to verify a survey matches design criteria
