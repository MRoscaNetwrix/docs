# Report Settings Tab

The Report Settings tab is for configuring publishing of Access Analyzer reports generated by this job. Choose either to use the default settings, which could be either the global configuration or configuration set via broken inheritance at a job group level, or to configure settings just for this job.

Use the Publish Options drop-down menu to customize the publish setting for the job. To configure custom Email settings for the job, select the **Use These Email Settings** option and then provide the desired Email information. Multiple email addresses can be input by adding a semicolon (;) and space between entries. See the [Reporting Node](../../Group/Reporting#_Reporting_Node:_Job "Reporting Node") topic for additional information on the Publish and Email options.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if no changes were made.
