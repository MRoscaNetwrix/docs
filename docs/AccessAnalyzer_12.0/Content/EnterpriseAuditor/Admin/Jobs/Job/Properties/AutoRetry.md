# Auto Retry Tab

The Auto Retry tab provides the option to schedule the job to re-execute against hosts that match the selected host status values: Offline, Failed, Errors, and Warnings.

Check the desired Host Status values to generate a retry, and then configure the Refresh Data and Retry Options settings. Finally, enter a User name (domain\user) and Password in the Scheduler Authentication section.

**NOTE:** To update the password for an existing account, enter a new password in the Password field.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if no changes were made.
