# History Tab

The History tab is for configuring the Data Retention and Log Retention periods. Choose either to use the default settings, which could be either the global configuration or configuration set via broken inheritance at a job group level, or to configure settings just for this job.

By default, all jobs are set to inherit the Data Retention Period and Log Retention Period settings, the **Use Default Setting** option. Deselect the **Use Default Settings** option to configure custom settings for the job. Then provide the desired Data Retention Period and Log Retention Period settings. See the [History](../../../Settings/History "History") topic for additional information.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if no changes were made.
