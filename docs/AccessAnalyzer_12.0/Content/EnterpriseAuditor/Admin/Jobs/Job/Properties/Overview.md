# Job Properties

Jobs can be configured to inherit global settings down through parent job groups or to be individually configured at the job level through the Job Properties window.

To configure a job’s properties, open the Job Properties window by right-clicking on the job's node in the Navigation pane and selecting **Properties**.

The properties can be configured at the job level within the Job Properties window using the following tabs:

* [General Tab](General "General Tab")
* [Performance Tab](Performance "Performance Tab")
* [Notification Tab](Notification "Notification Tab")
* [Report Settings Tab](ReportSettings "Report Settings Tab")
* [Report Roles Tab](ReportRoles "Report Roles Tab")
* [Storage Tab](Storage "Storage Tab")
* [Connection Tab](Connection "Connection Tab")
* [Auto Retry Tab](AutoRetry "Auto Retry Tab")
* [History Tab](History "History Tab")

You can click the **View XML** button at the bottom of the window to open the job’s XML file. See the [View Job XML File](ViewXML "View Job XML File") for additional information.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if no changes were made.
