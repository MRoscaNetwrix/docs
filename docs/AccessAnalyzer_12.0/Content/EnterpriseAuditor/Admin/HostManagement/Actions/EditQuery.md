Use the **Edit Query** option to modify host lists created by a Host Discovery query.

In the Navigation pane, select the query-created host list to edit and click **Edit Query**. The Host Discovery Wizard opens to the Query page where the query settings for the selected query-created host list are modified. See the [Host Discovery Wizard](../../HostDiscovery/Wizard/Overview "Host Discovery Wizard") topic for information on modifying these settings.
