# Save Selected To List

Use the **Save Selected To List** option to create a static host list. This option is available from either the Host Management node or an individual host list node. See the [Static Host Lists](../Lists#_Static_Host_Lists "Static Host Lists") topic for additional information on static host lists. This option is inactive until at least one host within the data grid is selected.

Use the Windows Ctrl + left-click function to select multiple hosts from the data grid. In the Activities pane, click **Save Selected To List**. The Host List Wizard opens with the selected hosts in the Host list box on the Manual Host Entry page. See the [Add Hosts](Add "Add Hosts") topic for information on creating a host list.
