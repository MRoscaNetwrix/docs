# Upgrade SharePoint Agent

Follow the steps to upgrade the SharePoint Agent.

![Windows Control Panel Uninstall or change a program window](../../../../../../static/images/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/Content/Resources/Images/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/SharePointAgent/Uninstall.png "Windows Control Panel Uninstall or change a program window")

**Step 1 –** From Programs and Features (**Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Programs and Features**), uninstall the previous version of SharePoint Agent.

**NOTE:** If you have the old Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On installed, you must uninstall it before continuing with this upgrade. For Access Analyzer 12.0, Sensitive Data Discovery is installed as part of the main installation if your license includes it.

**Step 2 –** Install the new version of the SharePoint Agent. See the [Installing the SharePoint Agent](Wizard "Installing the SharePoint Agent") topic for instructions.

Now that the SharePoint Agent has been upgraded, it can be used by the SharePoint Solution. See the [SharePoint Solution](../../Solutions/SharePoint/Overview "SharePoint Solution") topic for additional information.
