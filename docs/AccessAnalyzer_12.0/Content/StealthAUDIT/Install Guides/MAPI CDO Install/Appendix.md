# Appendix for the StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO Installation Guide

**CAUTION:** The Access Analyzer MAPI CDO must be installed first before installing the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO.

Before installing either binary, close the Access Analyzer application and ensure the following requirements have been met:

* Exchange System Manager for Exchange 2003 is not installed on the Access Analyzer Console server.
* Microsoft Outlook is not installed on the Access Analyzer Console server.

These programs will interfere with the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO installation and with MAPI connections if they are installed on the Access Analyzer Console server.

Follow these steps to install the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO.

**Step 1 –** Download and run the ExchangeMapiCDO application from Microsoft.

**NOTE:** The steps may be slightly different than the following. See Microsoft’s website for additional detail.
