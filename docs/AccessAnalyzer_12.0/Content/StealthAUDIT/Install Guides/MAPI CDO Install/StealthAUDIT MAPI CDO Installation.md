The Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO is only required to run the MAPI-based data collectors. See the [Exchange Solution](../../../EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/Exchange/Overview "Exchange Solution") topic for additional information.

The Access Analyzer MAPI CDO can be downloaded from the [Product Downloads](https://www.stealthbits.com/product-downloads "Opens the Stealthbits Product Downloads page in a new window") page of the Netwrix website. The Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO can be downloaded directly from Microsoft. See the [Appendix for the StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO Installation Guide](Appendix "Navigates to the Appendix for the StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO Installation Guide section") for requirements and installation steps to install the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO.

**CAUTION:** The Access Analyzer MAPI CDO must be installed first before installing the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO.

Before installing either binary, close the Access Analyzer application and ensure the following requirements have been met:

* Exchange System Manager for Exchange 2003 is not installed on the Access Analyzer Console server.
* Microsoft Outlook is not installed on the Access Analyzer Console server.

These programs interfere with MAPI connections if they are installed on the Access Analyzer Console server.

Follow the steps to install the Access Analyzer MAPI CDO.

**Step 1 –** Run the StealthAuditMapiCDO executable.
