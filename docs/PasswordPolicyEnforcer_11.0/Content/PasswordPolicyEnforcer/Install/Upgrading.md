# Upgrading Password Policy Enforcer

Upgrades are supported for versions 9.0 and above. Contact Customer Support at [https://www.netwrix.com/support.html](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html "Open Netwrix Support site") if you need assistance upgrading older versions

You can also install/uninstall the products using command line [Silent Installation](../Administration/Command Line Interface#Silent "Silent Installation").

Upgrading the Password Policy Server

The Password Policy Enforcer installer detects existing installations and upgrades them to 11. See the [Install Password Policy Enforcer on a Server](InstallationServer "Installation") topic for additional information. If you are performing an automated installation with Group Policy, then add the new **.msi** installer files to the same Group Policy Object used to install the older version. See the [Install with Group Policy Management](InstallationGPM#_bookmark9 "Install with GPM") topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** Upgrade all your servers and domain controllers. Configuration changes performed with the new version do not affect servers running an older version. If you have multiple versions, you must make configuration changes in both configuration consoles until all domain controllers are upgraded to 11. Failure to do so may lead to inconsistent enforcement of the password policy.

Open the [License](../Administration/ConfigConsole#License "Check your license") settings on the Configuration Console after an upgrade to check your license details. Password Policy Enforcer reverts to a 30-day evaluation license if it cannot import the license key.

Upgrading the Password Policy Client

The Password Policy Client installer detects existing installations and upgrades them to 11. See the [Install Password Policy Enforcer Client](InstallationClient "Install the Client")[Install Password Policy Enforcer Client](InstallationClient#_bookmark66 "Password Policy Client") topic for additional information. If you are distributing the Password Policy Client with Group Policy, then add the new client **.msi** file to the same Group Policy Object used to install the older version. Upgrade and reboot the Password Policy Servers before upgrading the clients.

The Password Policy Enforcer 11 Password Policy Server is backwards compatible with the V10.x and V9.x Password Policy Client. You are not required to update the Password Policy Clients, but it is recommended.

Upgrading theÂ Mailer

The Password Policy Enforcer installer detects existing installations of the Password Policy Enforcer Mailer and upgrades them to 11. See the [Install Mailer Service](InstallationMailer#_bookmark76 "Installing the Mailer") topic for additional information.
