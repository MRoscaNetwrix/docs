2. Trial Use.

   You are authorized to use the Software for evaluation purposes during a trial use term of thirty (30) days, unless prior to the expiration of the trial use term this license is terminated by You for convenience or terminated by either party for material breach. You have the option to register for full use of the Software at any time by paying the required license fee. Registration will authorize You to use an unlocking key which will convert the Software to full use, subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. Your use of the Software under this trial use license for any purpose after the expiration of the initial trial use term is not authorized without the prior written consent of Netwrix. Upon expiration of the limited trial use term, the Software may automatically disable itself. Immediately upon expiration of the limited trial use term, You shall either register for full use of the Software, or destroy all copies of the Software and documentation.

3. Perpetual Term.

   If You purchase a perpetual license, then the term of the license granted herein shall be perpetual unless terminated by You for convenience or terminated by either party for material breach.

   Immediately upon termination of this license for any reason, You shall destroy all copies of the Software and documentation.

4. Subscription Term(s).

   If You purchase a subscription license, then the term of this license is on a subscription basis with an initial term of one (1) year, and optional renewal terms of one (1) year each, unless prior to renewal this license is terminated by You for convenience or terminated by either party for material breach. Renewal procedures are available from Netwrix, and unless such procedures are strictly satisfied, including the payment of any required license fee, Your use of the Software for any purpose after the expiration of the subscription term is not authorized. Upon expiration of the subscription term, the Software may automatically disable itself. Immediately upon expiration or termination of this license for any reason, You shall destroy all copies of the Software and documentation.

5. License Grant.

   You are granted non-exclusive rights to install and use the Software on any computer and/or transmit the Software over a computer network, provided that You acquire and dedicate a licensed copy of the Software for each user who may access the Software. A license for the Software may not be shared or used concurrently by different users. You may purchase additional licenses for the Software from time to time. This Agreement shall take precedence over any purchase order for additional licenses, and any conflicting, inconsistent, or additional terms in such purchase orders shall be null and void.

Netwrix warrants only to You that the Software shall, in unmodified form, perform substantially in accordance with accompanying documentation under normal use for a period of thirty (30) days from the purchase date. The entire and exclusive liability and remedy for breach of this Limited Warranty shall be, at Netwrix option, either (i) return of the amount received by Netwrix for the Software, or (ii) replacement of defective Software and/or documentation. NETWRIX AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND RESELLERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, AND DATA ACCURACY. THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, ACCURACY, PURPOSE, OR NEED, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE LIMITED WARRANTY. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. No action for the above Limited Warranty may be commenced after one (1) year following the expiration date of the warranty. To the extent that this Warranty Statement is inconsistent with the jurisdiction where You use the Software, the Warranty Statement shall be deemed to be modified consistent with such local law. Under such local law, certain limitations may not apply, and You may have additional rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, some states in the United States and some jurisdictions outside the United States may: (i) preclude the disclaimers and limitations of this Warranty Statement from limiting the rights of a consumer; (ii) otherwise restrict the ability of a manufacturer to make such disclaimers or to impose such limitations; or (iii) grant the consumer additional legal rights, specify the duration of implied warranties which the manufacturer cannot disclaim, or prohibit limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts.

INDEPENDENT OF THE FORGOING PROVISIONS, IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, OR STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY, SHALL NETWRIX OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF COMMERCIAL DAMAGE, EVEN IF NETWRIX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

IN NO EVENT SHALL NETWRIX'S LIABILITY FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID, IF ANY, FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.

EXPORT CONTROLS. You agree to comply with all local laws in Your jurisdiction which might impact Your right to import, export or use the Software, and You represent that You have complied with any regulations or registration procedures required by applicable law to make this license enforceable.
