# Notifications

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when an action is expected, or a job ends with
an error.

Identity Manager provides [ Native Notifications ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/notifications/native-notifications/index.md) for usual cases, for example
provisioning review, resource reconciliation, and role reconciliation.

[ Custom Notifications ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/notifications/custom-notifications.md) can be configured for specific needs, to be triggered by a
workflow, or periodically via a task.
