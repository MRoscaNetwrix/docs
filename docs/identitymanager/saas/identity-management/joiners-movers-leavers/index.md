# Identity Lifecycle: Joiners, Movers and Leavers

Identities' Joiners, Movers and Leavers (JML) process can be made easy by using the adequate model:
records.

In Identity Manager, the JML process is done through workflows or through synchronization to the HR
system.

See the [ Onboarding and Offboarding ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identity-management/joiners-movers-leavers/onboarding-offboarding.md) and
[ Position Change via Records ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identity-management/joiners-movers-leavers/position-changes.md) topics for additional information on
onboarding and offboarding and position changes via records.
