# End-User Authentication

## Overview

Before end-users can connect to Identity Manager through the UI, they will have to authenticate.

Identity Manager supports seven authentication methods organized into two categories: Internal
methods and External methods.

It is highly recommended that you use an External method. Internal methods are mostly used for
debug, test and development purposes.

**Internal methods**

The Internal methods use Identity Manager Server's internal authentication server. They rely on one
of these Identity Server User Stores:

- Test User Store, used in development environments.
- Active Directory User Store, using an Active Directory to authenticate.

**External methods**

External methods use external authentication providers.

Identity Manager supports five types of external authentication providers of which four are based on
different flavors of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and the last one is integrated with Windows.

The types of authentication providers supported by Identity Manager are:

- [OpenIdConnect](https://openid.net/connect/)
- [WS-Federation](http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsfed/federation/v1.2/ws-federation.html)
- [OAuth](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
- [SAML2](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html)
- [Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/integrated-windows-authentication)

**Using more than one provider**

For each authentication method, one or several authentication providers can be set up. If several
authentication providers are set up, end-users will be prompted to choose their preferred method of
authentication.

External method prompt:

## Identity Server RSA Key Pair

A public key certificate and a private key are used to handle encrypted communication with external
authentication providers. This is used, for example, by the Identity Manager Server to retrieve the
provider's signing key. It is mandatory to validate JWT tokens in an OAuth-flavor scenario.

This information can be set one of two ways:

- As a [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive (also called `.pfx` file) stored in
  the Agent's host file system. The archive contains both the public key certificate and the private
  key.
- As a certificate from a Windows'
  [certificate store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates#certificate-store)
  identified by SubjectDistinguishedName or by Thumbprint. The Windows certificate also contains
  both the public key certificate and the private key.

### PFX file

The archive is set using the following attributes on the appsettings > IdentityServer section:

- X509KeyFilePath is the [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive path on the
  Agent's host file system.
- X509KeyFilePassword (optional) is the [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive
  password.

**Example**

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
  "<IdentityServer>": {
    "X509KeyFilePath":C:/identitymanagerAgentContoso/contoso.pfx",
    "X509KeyFilePassword": "oarjr6r9f00"
  }

```

### Certificate

The certificate from a Windows certificate store is set up using these attributes on the
appsettings > IdentityServer section:

| Name                                                               | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X509SubjectDistinguishedName optional (if Thumbprint is non-empty) | Sets the store certificate's SubjectDistinguishedName.                                   |
| X509Thumbprint optional (if DistinguishedName is non-empty)        | Sets the store certificate's Thumbprint.                                                 |
| X509StoreLocation required                                         | Sets the Relevant Windows certificate store's location: `LocalMachine` or `CurrentUser`. |
| X509StoreName required                                             | Sets the relevant Windows certificate store's name.                                      |

**Example**

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
"<IdentityServer>": {
    "X509SubjectDistinguishedName":"<UsercubeContoso>",
    "X509StoreLocation": "<LocalMachine>",
    "X509StoreName": "<AuthRoot>"
}

```

:::note
Identity Manager Server won't start if the
[PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive set up during this step is identical to
the one provided with the SDK. Users must provide their own certificate. Self-signed certificates
are accepted as valid. See
the[Install the Server](/docs/identitymanager/saas/installation-guide/production-ready/server/index.md)topic for
additional information.
:::


## Configuration Section Description

Authentication is set up using the following two sections of the Server's appsettings set:

- IdentityServer
- Authentication

```
{
    "IdentityServer":{
        ...
    },
    "Authentication":{
        ...
    }
}

```

The authentication section mostly fits the following pattern:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
"<Authentication>":{
    <Authentication Protocol 1>:{
          <Authentication Provider 1>:{
                  ...
          },
          ....,
          <Authentication Provider n>:{
                  ...
          },
    },
    <Authentication Protocol 2>:{
          <Authentication Provider 1>:{
                  ...
          },
          ....,
          <Authentication Provider n>:{
                  ...
          },
    }
}

```

Several authentication providers can be defined (here above, `<Authentication Provider 1>` to
`<Authentication Provider n>`), using one or several authentication protocols (here above,
`<Authentication Protocol 1>` and `<Authentication Protocol 2>`).

Most of the authentication providers need the user to choose an AuthenticationScheme. It is a string
that will be used to uniquely identify this authentication method in Identity Manager. Its goal is
to enable Identity Manager's testers to identify which authentication method is used in the logs or
in the code, with a mnemonic name. Any name can be used as long as all AuthenticationSchemes are
different.

:::note
This guide doesn't cover how to set up authorizations within Identity Manager.
Authorization for an end-user to access Identity Manager resources relies on assigning roles to
profiles. Identity credentials used for authentication must be linked to these profiles in the
applicative configuration. See the [Various XML Settings](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/network-configuration/settings/index.md)topic for
additional information.
:::


Authentication-related settings are done through the following sections of the appsettings set:

- IdentityServer
- Authentication

See the[Architecture](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/architecture/index.md)topic for additional information.

### Identity Server

This is the general-purpose authentication settings section.

The Identity Server section allows the following attributes:

| Name                                              | Type         | Description                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enabled (default value: true)                     | Boolean      | Enables or disables the Identity Server.                                                                                 |

| PostLogoutRedirectUri (optional)                  | String       | Sets a specific URI to which the user will be redirected after a successful logout.                                      |
| PublicOrigin (optional)                           | String       | Sets the origin name for this Identity Manager Server instance. Useful if end-users authenticate through a proxy server. |
| X509File (required)                               | String       | Is the [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive path on the Agent's host file system.                   |
| X509KeyFilePassword (optional)                    | String       | Is the [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive password.                                               |
| X509SubjectDistinguishedName (optional)           | String       | Sets the store certificate's SubjectDistinguishedName.                                                                   |

| X509StoreLocation (required)                      | String       | Sets the relevant Windows certificate store's location.                                                                  |
| X509StoreName (required)                          | String       | Sets the relevant Windows certificate store's name.                                                                      |

### Authentication

This section contains specific settings for each configuration method.

At the root, the following properties can be used:

| Name                                     | Type    | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enabled default value: true              | Boolean | Enables or disables authentication.                                                                          |
| RequireHttpsMetadata default value: true | Boolean | Specifies whether HTTPS is required for the discovery endpoint.                                              |
| AllowLocalLogin required                 | Boolean | If `true`, a Login Form replaces Windows Authentication.                                                     |
| CookieLifeTime default value: 8          | Int     | Maximum duration (in hours) after which the session expires automatically.                                   |
| LifeTimeSliding default value: 10        | Int     | Duration (in minutes) after which the session expires automatically, if no action is taken during this time. |

Then, a subsection for every authentication method is used. Supported subsections are:

- OpenId
- OAuth
- WsFederation
- SAML2
- ActiveDirectoryUserStore
- TestUserStore

## Set Up Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA)

This authentication method can be used to authenticate users within an Active Directory domain using
their respective domain account.

This authentication is silent: when an end-user tries to access Identity Manager, the browser
retrieves identity credentials from the Windows session where the user is logged in and sends them
to the domain controller for authentication. The domain controller confirms the user's identity and
validates it for Identity Manager. The end-user doesn't have to input any credentials.

:::note
If Integrated Windows Authentication is used, internal methods have to be disabled with
the `"AllowLocalLogin":false` setting.
:::


### Requirements

Setting up this authentication method requires the following:

- Identity Manager runs as an [Internet Information Services (IIS)](https://www.iis.net/) website.
- Windows Authentication is
  [enabled on Windows server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016).
- Windows Authentication is
  [enabled for the Usercube IIS ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/authentication/windowsauthentication/#enabled-for-the-usercube-iis)[enabled for the Usercube IIS website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/authentication/windowsauthentication/#enabled-for-the-usercube-iis-website)
  website.

### Configuration

Integrated Windows Authentication is configured using the following sections:

- Set the **IdentityServer** > **AllowWindowsAuthentication** attribute to `true`.

- Set the **Authentication** > **AllowLocalLogin** attribute to `false`.

1. Set the **IdentityServer** > **AllowWindowsAuthentication** attribute to `true`.
2. Set the **Authentication** > **AllowLocalLogin** attribute to `false`.

> The following example sets up Windows Authentication. Windows Server and IIS requirements have
> been checked.
>
> Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
> script in the command line.
>
> ```
> appsettings.json
> ...
> "<IdentityServer>":{
>     "AllowWindowsAuthentication":"<true>",
> },
> "<Authentication>":{
>     "AllowLocalLogin":"<false>",
> }
> ...
>
> ```

## Set Up an OpenID Connect Provider

One or several OpenID Connect authentication providers can be set up under the Authentication >
OpenId section.

**Multiple providers**

One or several OpenID Connect authentication providers can be set up.

**Registration process**

Using an OpenID Connect authentication requires the Identity Manager Server to be registered to the
provider. A ClientID and a ClientSecret are issued as a result of the registration process. They
both allow Identity Manager to identify itself to the authentication provider.
[](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-settings)[See an example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-settings)
of how to register Identity Manager to an Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Microsoft Azure AD) used as
OpenID Connect provider.

**Callback URL**

The target OpenID Connect provider needs to be aware of the URI where to send the authentication
token if the authentication succeeds. Depending on the provider, it is called a callback URL, a
callback path, an authorization callback URL, or a redirect URI.

During the registration process, the provider will ask for the URL.

Identity Manager's callback URL for OpenID Connect is `<usercube-server-address>/signin-oidc` where
`<usercube-server-address>` is the address of your Identity Manager Server such as
`https://identitymanager.contoso.com`.

**Authority**

An OpenID Connect provider is identified by its Authority, according to the
[OpenID ](https://openid.net/connect/)Connect specifications.

**NameClaimType**

To authorize an end-user, Identity Manager Server retrieves a specific claim (a key-value pair,
transmitted through the OIDC-issued JWT token) returned by the provider and looks for a resource
that matches this claim's value. The comparison is carried out according to the resource and
property set as the end-user's identity in the applicative configuration. See the
[Select User by Identity Query Handler Setting](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/metadata/settings/selectuserbyidentityqueryhandlersetting/index.md)

The name of the claim that is retrieved for this purpose defaults to `sub` which is one of the
standard
[Claim names for the OpenID Connect protocol](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#claim-names-for-the-openid-connect-protocol).
However, some providers might not fill the `sub` value with meaningful data, or use non-standard
Claim names.

For this reason, the name of the claim that is retrieved by Identity Manager for authorization
purposes can be set up according to the provider's specifics.

:::note
Users should be able to get a list of the claim names used by their authentication
providers from their providers' portal website, documentation or administrators.
:::


For example, the following claim provides no meaningful `sub` value.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
{
    "name": "<John Doe>",
    "preferred_username": "<john.doe@contoso.com>",
    "sub": "<11v7ert42azerttyZD6d4>"
}

```

Using the following applicative configuration setting that sets `Ad_Entry:userPrincipalName` as the
value to be matched against a claim in order to identify a user's profile, the `preferred_username`
NameClaimType should be used.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
 <SelectUserByIdentityQueryHandlerSetting 
 ResourceIdentityProperty="AD_Entry:userPrincipalName>" ... />

```

### Configuration

First, the OpenID Connect method must be enabled.

Under the OpenId section:

| Name             | Type    | Description                                |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Enabled required | Boolean | Enables or disables the OpenId connection. |

For each OpenID Connect provider to integrate, a new section is added under the OpenID subsection.
Any section name can be used. This section name is only used as a means for the user to find the
authentication method in the configuration files.

Under the new subsection, the following parameters are used to configure the authentication method:

| Name                                     | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AuthenticationScheme required            | String  | Is the unique identifier of this authentication method within Identity Manager. Any string value can be used, unique among all authentication methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| DisplayName optional                     | String  | Is the provider display name.

**Example**

This example configures an OpenId Connect authority located at
[https://login.microsoftonline.com/bbd35166-7c13-49f3-8041-9551f2847b69](https://login.microsoftonline.com/bbd35166-7c13-49f3-8041-9551f2847b69).

This authentication provider is identified within the appsettings.json OpenId Connect providers list
as OpenId1.

Within Identity Manager, it will be identified with the authentication scheme AzureOIDC.

It will be displayed as Connection Microsoft Entra ID with OIDC protocol in the UI external login
prompt.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
{
    "Authentication":
    {
        ...
        "OpenId": {
            "Enabled": "<True>",
            "OpenId1": {
                "AuthenticationScheme": "<AzureOIDC>",
                "DisplayName": "<Connection Microsoft Entra ID with OIDC protocol>",
                "ClientId": "<6779ef20e75817b79602>",
                "ClientSecret": "<5ef0234c039c725e21ffc727a60c44895a39dce1c81ae36dc5d002feae82c1c0>",

## Set Up an OAuth Provider

One or several OAuth authentication providers can be set up under the authentication > OAuth
section.

**Multiple providers**

One or several OAuth authentication providers can be set up.

**Registration process**

Using an OAuth authentication requires Identity Manager Server to be registered to the provider. A
ClientID and a ClientSecret are issued as a result of the registration process. They both allow
Identity Manager to identify itself to the authentication provider.

#### Callback URL

The target OAuth provider needs to be aware of the URI where to send the authentication token if the
authentication succeeds. Depending on the provider, it is called a callback URL, a callback path, an
authorization callback URL, or a redirect URI.

During the registration process, the provider will ask for the URL.

Identity Manager's callback URL for OAuth is `<usercube-server-address>`/`<callback-path>` where
`<usercube-server-address>` is the address of your Identity Manager Server such as
https://identitymanager.contoso.com and `<callback-path>` can be set up to any value chosen by the user
using the CallbackPath configuration attribute. The only constraint is to make sure the CallbackPath
value in Identity Manager's configuration is the same as in the OAuth provider registration screen
for Identity Manager.

### Configuration

First, the OAuth method must be enabled under the authentication > OAuth section.

| Name             | Type    | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Enabled required | Boolean | Enables or disables the OAuth connection. |

Then, users must create a new section per OAuth provider. Users are free to choose any section name.
Its sole purpose is for users to find the authentication method in the configuration files.

Each section is configured with the following settings:

| Name                            | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Example**

The following example configures an OAuth-based authentication provider identified as
OAuthContoso_Washington in the configuration file.

It will be displayed as Contoso OAuth Washington in the UI external login prompt, and uniquely
identified within Identity Manager by the authentication scheme contoso_0987.

Identity Manager Server marks received claims using
[https://accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com) as a claim issuer identifier.

/signin-oauth has been chosen as CallbackPath and set up as such in the OAuth provider's portal
during Identity Manager's registration.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
{
    "Authentication":
    {
        ...
        "OAuth": {
            "Enabled": "<True>",
            "OAuthContoso_Washington": {

## Set Up a WS-Federation Provider

One or several WS-Federation authentication providers can be set up under the authentication >
WsFederation subsection. Examples of WS-Federation providers include Active Directory Federation
Services (ADFS) and Microsoft Entra ID (AAD).

**Multiple providers**

One or several WS-Federation authentication providers can be set up.

**Registration process**

Using a WS-Federation authentication requires Identity ManagerServer to be registered to the
provider. A Wtrealm value is set up during the registration process. The value can be generated by
the provider, or set manually as a URL-shaped string value. This allows Identity Manager to identify
itself to the authentication provider. Here are two examples of registration process:

- with an
  [Active Directory Federation Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/ws-federation?view=aspnetcore-5.0#active-directory-federation-services)
  provider
- with an
  [Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/ws-federation?view=aspnetcore-5.0#microsoft-entra-id)
  provider

**Callback URL**

The target WS-Federation provider needs to be aware of the URI where to send the authentication
token if the authentication succeeds. Depending on the provider, it is called a callback URL, a
callback path, an authorization callback URL, or a redirect URI.

During the registration process, the provider will ask for the URL.

Identity Manager's callback URL for WS-Federation is
`<Identity Manager-server-address>`/signin-wsfed where `<usercube-server-address>` is the address of
your Identity Manager Server such as https://identitymanager.contoso.com.

**Encryption algorithm**

The nature of the encryption algorithm used for exchanging the sign-in key with the provider is
automatically negotiated between Identity Manager Server and the authentication server. The most
secure algorithm that both systems support is chosen.

### Configuration

First, the WS-Federation must be enabled under the authentication > WsFederation section:

| Name             | Type    | Description                                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enabled required | Boolean | Enables or disables the **WS-Federation** authentication. |

Then, users must create a new subsection per **WS-Federation** provider. They are free to choose any
section name. Its sole purpose is for users to find the authentication method in the configuration
files.

Each section is configured with the following settings:

| Name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Set Up SAML2 Authentication

One or several **SAML2** authentication providers can be set up under the authentication > SAML2
section.

Identity Manager does not provide a signature for SAML2 authentication.

**Multiple providers**

One or several **SAML2** authentication providers can be set up.

**Registration process**

Using a **SAML2** authentication requires Identity Manager Server to be registered to the provider.
An **Entity ID URI** value is set up for Identity Manager during the registration process. It is
used as the prefix for scopes and as the value of the audience claim in access tokens. The value can
be generated by the provider, or set manually as a URL-shaped string value. This allows Identity
Manager to identify itself to the authentication provider.

**Reply URL**

The target **SAML2** provider needs to be aware of the URI where to send the authentication token if
the authentication succeeds. This URI is called **Reply URL** or **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS)
URL**.

During the registration process, the provider will ask for the URL.

Identity Manager's **Reply URL** for **SAML2** is `<usercube-server-address>`/Saml2/Acs where
`<usercube-server-address>` is the address of your Identity Manager Server such as
https://identitymanager.contoso.com.

Make sure to enter this exact URL which is treated case sensitively.

**Configuration**

First, the SAML2 method must be enabled under the authentication > SAML2 section.

| Name             | Type    | Description                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Enabled required | Boolean | Enables or disables SAML2 Authentication. |

Then, users must create a new subsection per SAML2 provider. Users are free to choose any section
name. Its sole purpose is for users to find the authentication method in the configuration files.

Each section is configured with the following settings:

| Name                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MetaDataLocation required            | Identifies, for Identity Manager, the target SAML2 server's metadata. This information is to be retrieved from the app registration process or directly from the SAML2 provider. The value commonly ends with the path /FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml.              |
| IdentityProviderEntityID required    | Is the Identity Provider Issuer (also known as provider Entity ID) that identifies the provider to Identity Manager. This information is to be retrieved from the provider's portal. For Microsoft Entra ID, it is the first line of metadata file.                                     |
| DisplayName optional                 | Is the provider display name.

### Encryption Certificate

This information can be set one of two ways:

- As a [Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive
  (also called
  [Personal ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/personal-information-exchange---pfx--files)Information
  Exchange file or `.pfx` file) stored in the Agent's host file system. The archive contains both
  the public key certificate and the private key.
- As a certificate from a Windows'
  [certificate store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates#certificate-store)
  identified by SubjectDistinguishedName or by Thumbprint. The Windows certificate also contains
  both the public key certificate and the private key.

:::tip
Remember, Netwrix recommends using Windows' certificate store.
:::


On the other hand, the PFX file takes priority over Windows' certificate, which means that when
`File` is specified then the PFX certificate is used, even if the options for Windows' certificate
are specified too.

In both ways, missing and/or incorrect settings trigger an error and no certificate is loaded.

:::tip
Remember, the AzureKeyVault section is mandatory when using CertificateAzureKeyVault. Identity
Manager server loads the encryption certificate from Azure Key Vault only if the AzureKeyVault and
EncryptionCertificate are defined at the same level in the configuration file.
:::


#### As a PFX file

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
{
    ...
    "EncryptionCertificate": {
        "File": "<C:/identitymanagerAgentContoso/contoso.pfx>",
        "Password": "<oarjr6r9f00>"
     }
 }
```

The archive is set using the following attributes:

| Name              | Type   | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File required     | String | [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive path on the host file system. |
| Password optional | String | [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive password.                     |

Storing a `.pfx` file password in plain text in a production environment is strongly discouraged. It
should always be encrypted using the Identity Manager-Protect-CertificatePassword tool. See the
[Usercube-Protect-CertificatePassword](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/executables/references/protect-certificatepassword/index.md)
topic for additional information.

The archive is set using the following attributes:

| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File required     | String | [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive path on the host file system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Password optional | String | [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) archive password. Storing a `.pfx` file's password in plain text in a production environment is strongly discouraged. It should always be encrypted using the Usercube-Protect-CertificatePassword.exe[ ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/executables/references/protect-certificatepassword/index.md)tool. |

#### As a Certificate in the Windows Store

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
 {
    ...
    "EncryptionCertificate": {
         "DistinguishedName":"<UsercubeContoso>",
         "StoreLocation": "<LocalMachine>",
         "StoreName": "<AuthRoot>"
     }
 }
```

The Windows certificate is set using these attributes:

| Name                         | Type   | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DistinguishedName (optional) | String | SubjectDistinguishedName of the store certificate. **NOTE:** This is required when Thumbprint is not specified. |
| Thumbprint (optional)        | String | Thumbprint of the store certificate. **NOTE:** This is required when DistinguishedName is not specified.        |
| StoreLocation (required)     | String | Location of the relevant Windows certificate store: LocalMachine or CurrentUser.                                |
| StoreName (required)         | String | Name of the relevant Windows certificate store.                                                                 |

##### Using Azure Key Vault

If the certificate is saved in Azure Key Vault, we must define the certificate identifier and the
Vault connection. See the [Azure Key Vault](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/azure-key-vault/index.md)
topic for additional information.

:::tip
Remember, the AzureKeyVault section is mandatory when using CertificateAzureKeyVault. Identity
Manager server loads the encryption certificate from Azure Key Vault only if the AzureKeyVault and
EncryptionCertificate are defined at the same level in the configuration file.
:::


Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
{
    "Authentication": {
        ...
        "SAML2": {
            "Enabled": true,
            "<SAMLConnection>": {
                ...
                "AzureKeyVault": {
                    "Vault": "<https://contoso.vault.azure.net/>",
                    "ConnectionString": "..."
                },
                "EncryptionCertificate": {
                    "CertificateAzureKeyVault": "<ContosoCertificate>"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Set Up Internal Methods

When Internal Methods is enabled, the end-user is prompted via a form to input a login and a
password. The login to be used is defined within the applicative configuration's Select User By
Identity Query Handler Setting element. See the [Various XML Settings](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/network-configuration/settings/index.md)
topic for additional information.

First, the AllowLocalLogin parameter needs to be set to true in the Authentication section.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
"<Authentication>":{
    "AllowLocalLogin":true
}
```

Then, Active Directory User Store or Test User Store can be enabled.

### Active Directory User Store

The Active Directory User Store allows users to authenticate with a login and password that will be
compared against the Active Directory content.

Several forests can be set up as identity providers for authentication. This allows, for example,
the authentication of users that belong to different Active Directory forests.

It is configured under the Authentication > ActiveDirectoryUserStore section.

First, the ActiveDirectoryUserStore must be enabled.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
"<Authentication>":{
    "AllowLocalLogin":true,
    "ActiveDirectoryUserStore": {
        "Enabled": true
        ...
    }
}
```

| Name             | Type    | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enabled required | Boolean | True to enable authentication via the Active Directory User Store. |

In the same section, several authentication providers can be defined, each one based on an Active
Directory forest.

For each forest, a new section is added under ActiveDirectoryUserStore. Any name may be chosen for
the forest section as long as it is unique. Two forest sections can't be identical though.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
"<ActiveDirectoryUserStore>": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "Forest1": {
        "AuthenticationScheme": "<...>",
        "Server": "<...>",
        ...
    }
}
```

Under the new forest section, the following parameters are used to configure the authentication
method.

> The following example sets a single authentication method, based on the Forest1 forest. The domain
> controller is located at 127.168.0.1. If the user enters the login MyLogin, the resulting logon
> will be CONTOSO\paris\MyLogin. The Postfix won't be used as a Prefix is already provided.
>
> Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
> script in the command line.
>
> ```
> "<ActiveDirectoryUserStore>": {
>   "Enabled": true,
>   "Forest1": {
>       "AuthenticationScheme": "<ADUserStore_Forest1>",
>       "Server": "<127.168.0.1>",
>       "Domain": "<CONTOSO>",
>       "Prefix": "<paris>",
>       "Postfix": "<usercube.contoso>"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> In the following example, if the user enters the login MyLogin, the resulting logon will be
> MyLogin@Identity Manager.contoso.
>
> Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the

>       "Postfix": "<usercube.contoso>"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> The following example enables authentication via the Active Directory User Store, for the Forest1
> forest,by checking not only the password and account activation, but also whether the password is
> expired.

| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AuthenticationScheme required | String  | Unique identifier of this authentication method within Identity Manager. Any string value can be used, unique among all authentication methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Server required               | String  | Identification of the domain controller that runs the Active Directory Domain Service against which the authentication is performed. Based on [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.protocols.ldapconnection?view=dotnet-plat-ext-8.0), the format is defined either: - by a domain name - by an LDAP server name - or a dotted string representing the IP address of the LDAP server/Domain Controller (example: 98.20.33.2). Optionally, this parameter may also include a port number, separated from the host by a colon (example: 98.20.33.2:4520). |
| Domain optional               | String  | Identification of the Active Directory domain or sub-domain against which the authentication will be performed. It is a string used to complete the user's logon in an INet name fashion. The resulting logon will resemble Domain\login. The domain is used only if no postfix was provided. This parameter is ignored if the domain or the UPN suffix is already specified in the login. This is the case for a login that conforms to the format domain\login or login@domain.com.                                                                                                                               |
| FastBind default value: True  | Boolean | True to check a user's credentials by verifying only the password and account activation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Test User Store

A Test User Store can be set up under the authentication > TestUserStore section. It allows all
users to authenticate with their login and the same password.

:::tip
Remember, this should never be used in a production environment.
:::


The following parameters are available under the authentication > TestUserStore section:

| Name              | Type    | Description                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enabled required  | Boolean | Enables or disables the OpenId Connection.                      |
| Password required | String  | Is the password for all users to authenticate Identity Manager. |

**Example**

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
{
    "Authentication":
    {
      "AllowLocalLogin":true
        ...
        "<TestUserStore>": {
            "Enabled": true,
            "Password": "<secret>"
        }
    }
}
Here is an example using both `IdentityServer` and `Authentication` sections.
appsettings.json
{
    ...
    "IdentityServer": {
        "X509KeyFilePath": "<./identitymanagerContoso.pfx>",
        "X509KeyFilePassword": "<secret>"
    },
    "Authentication": {
        "RequireHttpsMetadata": false,
        "TestUserStore": {
            "Enabled": "<true>",
            "Password": "<secret>"
        },
        "AllowLocalLogin": true
    }
    ...
}
```
