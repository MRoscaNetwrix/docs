# Notifications

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when an action is expected, or a job ends with
an error.

Identity Manager provides [Native Notifications](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/notifications/native/index.md) for usual cases, for example
provisioning review, resource reconciliation, and role reconciliation.

[Custom Notifications](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/notifications/custom/index.md) can be configured for specific needs, to be triggered by a
workflow, or periodically via a task.
