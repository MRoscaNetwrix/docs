# Assignment Policy

The assignment policy is the set of rules enforced on the resources to compute automatic assignments
and risks. It contains the role model and risks definition.

## The Role Model

The Introduction Guide introduced the role model and how it influences assigning entitlements to
identities. Let's sum up the key principles here. See the
[ Entitlement Management ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/index.md)
topic for additional information.

1. Identities are resources.
2. Assignments of entitlements are materialized by resources, their values and associations.
3. Identity Manager uses a [role-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
   assignment policy to grant entitlements to identities, i.e. granting a role entails granting
   entitlements.
4. The role model is first a catalog of available roles
   ([ Single Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md) and
   [ Composite Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerole/index.md)),
   identified by meaningful names aimed at non-technical end-users. These roles represent status of
   trust and privileges, to be assigned to identities, manually or automatically.
5. The role model is also a set of rules aiming at assign automatically roles to identities, based
   on relevant criteria, namely
   [ Dimension ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/metadata/dimension/index.md).
6. The role model classifies resources by security concerns thanks to resource types.
7. The role model contains correlation rules identifying ownership of target resource by an
   identity.
8. The role model contains provisioning rules describing if and how target resources and their
   values should be computed from source resource values.

Resource types, single roles and composite roles can be grouped into
[ Category ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/category/index.md). They are used in the
UI to organize the Roles catalog display. Categories are organized in a hierarchical tree structure.

### Policy

A [Policy](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/policy/index.md) is a set of assignment
rules. At least one policy must be declared.

All resource types, single roles and composite roles and categories belong to a policy.

## Dimensions And Contexts

One of Identity Manager's distinctive feature is the use of
[Attribute-Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)
methods to automatically grant fine-grained entitlements.

Every identity in the organization operates within a specific context. It is a set of information
relevant to making decisions about assigning entitlements for an identity. For example, an employee
working in the R&D department of the New York office at Contoso Corporation is associated with the
`{R&D, New York}` context.

Analyzing contexts in the organization allows the integration team, in collaboration with a
knowledgeable member of the target organization, to define key criteria on which to base assignments
of entitlements decisions. Those key criteria are called dimensions.

The integration team defines
[ Context Rule ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/contextrule/index.md) and
[ Record Section ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/recordsection/index.md)in the
applicative configuration that assigns, for every identity, a context as a set of dimension-value
pair.

The details of how contexts are generated can be found in
[ Generate Contexts ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/generate-contexts/index.md).

Every dimension is associated with a finite set of possible values. That means there is a finite set
of possible context. Hence, typical contexts within which an identity operates are modeled.

Contexts can then be used as a filter for choosing an identity to which to assign a role.

This mechanism allows the integration team to define rules to take care of the most basics and
repetitive assignments. For example, a
[Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md) assigning a
specific single role to the resources that match a specific context.

##### Example

A standard multi-site and multi-department organization would use the following dimensions:

- `Location`, the physical location where an employee works.
- `Department`, the employee working department, such as `IT`, `Sales` or `Accounting`.

Roles could be assigned based on location and department of the resource representing an identity.

For a rule such as "every employee that works in IT must have access to the servers room", the
`ServerRoomAccess` single role would be assigned to every resource of entity type `employee` whose
context contains the value `IT` for the dimension `Department`.

A context rule would have been written first, defining for every resource of entity type `employee`
how to compute a context: the `Department` dimension value is found in the `department` property of
the resource, the `Location` dimension value is found in the `site` property of the resource.

## Write Roles And Assignments Rules

The role model takes a very important place in the applicative configuration. It's built by the
integration team, in collaboration with the target organization, to match the organization's needs
and rules in security.

The role model is built iteratively, together with the [Entity Model](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/entity-model/index.md),
as they closely influence one another. See the [Entity Model](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/entity-model/index.md) topic for
additional information.

The role model evolves and lives during the whole IGA project's lifecycle. Organization rules
change, roles and assignment rules are updated, deleted, added.

The following gives a few ideas about how a to approach the writing of a role model.

### 1. Identify single roles

The first iteration of building of the organization reference model starts to reveal the archetypal
responsibilities and positions of the members of the organization. A
[ Single Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md) is defined for
every fine-grained organization-level responsibility or position.

##### Example

Contoso Corporation employs project managers in their Aircraft Design department to manage aircraft
design projects for clients all around the world. Those projects involve aerodynamics and structure
engineers, construction workers, quality control agents and sale engineers.

Everyone in the team needs to access the Internet to do research and send e-mails. That's a first
typical single role `Internet Access` that everyone should be assigned to be able to work.

Aerodynamics engineers need to access remote high-performance computation servers specifically
designed to solve aerodynamics equations. The sensitive nature of the data sent to those servers,
plus the availability constraints, require restricting access to engineers that absolutely need it
to perform their daily tasks. That's another responsibility, that can be translated to a single role
`Aerodynamics Computation Server` for example, that grants access to those servers.

Structure engineers, on the other hand, do not perform such heavy computations and do not need
access to the aerodynamics computation server. They can work locally, performing computations on
their own workstation. They're not assigned the `Aerodynamics Computation Server` role.

Quality control agents need access to sensitive information such as accident reports, on the
internal data server named `data0`. Those highly sensitive privileges are not assigned to everyone.
They can be translated to the `Data Server data0` role.

The project manager needs access to the `data0` and `data1` servers with client contracts. The
`Data Server data0` and `Data Server data1` roles translate those responsibilities.

### 2. Identify navigation rules and ownership

For every [ Single Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md) assigned
to an identity, fine-grained entitlements need to be granted. Those are the resource values in a
managed system.

Hence, for every single role, the relevant managed systems, type of resource, and resource values to
fulfill are identified.

They are materialized by:

- Provisioning rules, such as Resource Type rules that decide what resources should be found in the
  managed systems; and navigation rules or scalar rules, that identify actual values to be fulfilled
  from the identity to which the single role is assigned;
- [ Resource Correlation Rule ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcecorrelationrule/index.md)
  that identify for an identity, the target resources to fulfill;
- Resource type that organize resources and describe a source/target (or owner/resource)
  relationship.

    The resource types identified this way could be suggested to security officers for review,
    checking that they match their mental model of the managed system's resources.

    Sets of scalar rules and navigation rules relevant to a specific resource type are gathered into
    a resource type.

#### Example

Let's consider the `Internet Access` defined at step 1.

In practice, Contoso Corporation authorizes or block a user Internet access by setting per-user
outbound policies on their network firewall. The firewall integrates with Active Directory which
make it possible to use Active Directory groups membership to enable or disable policies for a user.

A security officer, to grant Internet access to an employee, would in practice assign a
`Internet Access` group membership to their Active Directory account. That is a fine-grained
entitlement entailed by the assignment of the `Internet Access` single role. That means that, to be
able to grant or restrict Internet access, the link between an identity and their Active Directory
account, used to login to work, must be known.

To modelize that need within the role model, every identity with `Internet Access` single role is
associated with an Active Directory account. We can find the Active Directory for an identity by
comparing the identity email with the Active Directory entry e-mail. That's an example of
[ Resource Correlation Rule ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcecorrelationrule/index.md)
that define the ownership of an Active Directory entry resource by an identity resource.

### 3. Write assignment rules

[Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md) describe
criteria for which a
[ Single Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md) is assigned to a
resource. The main criterion is a dimension value. For a given resource, the single role is assigned
if the resource's context matches the given dimension value. The second criterion is the assignment
of a specific
[ Composite Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerole/index.md) (see
further).

A navigation rule describes a fine-grained entitlement in the form of resource association such as a
group membership. Its enforcement is also conditioned by a single role assignment to the relevant
source resource, which in turn materializes the link between a single role and a resource type.

Those rules are used by Identity Manager to automate role assignments. They are absolutely optional.
A first version of the project can rely on manual assignments of single roles. Those have meaningful
names: Identity Manager already provides a value by allowing non-technical users to request or
assign entitlements. Navigation and or scalar rules can be written in a second time to allow
automated fulfillment. Single role rules can be written after that to set up automated assignments.

##### Example

The need for aerodynamics engineers to access the remote computation server is translated by a
single role rule: if the department (a dimension) of that identity is `Aerodynamics R&D` (a
dimension value), then the `Aerodynamics Computation Server` single role must be granted.

The need for assignment of the `Internet Access` group to the Active Directory account, if the
identity is assigned the `Internet Access` single role is modeled by a navigation rule that
stipulates that if that identity is assigned that role, then the `memberOf` property of the owned
Active Directory entry resource should be set to the AD group named `Internet Access`.

### 4. Use Composite Roles To Organize Single Roles (optional)

[ Single Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md) can be packaged
into [ Composite Role ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerole/index.md).
Assigning a composite role to an identity immediately assigns the packaged single role to that
identity. Single roles assigned this way are said to be inferred.

The [Composite Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerolerule/index.md)
(see composite role rules describe criteria for which a composite role is assigned to an identity.
Then, the composite role can be used as a condition in a
[Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md). This is
how packages are built.

### Summary - A mental model to help build a role model

To help build a role model, consider this mental model that captures the key events occurring
between the assignments of a role and the actual assignment of entitlement.

1. A resource-identity `Ri` is associated with a context `Ci`, i.e. dimension values.
2. `Ri` is assigned a single role `SRa`, manually or as a result of dimension comparisons.
3. Identity Manager's engine identifies a resource type `Rt` with the type rule `Tr` whose condition
   matches `SRa` and/or `Ci`.
4. Using `Rt`'s definition, Identity Manager's engine identifies by correlation a target resource
   `Tr` from the resource repository that must be created or updated to materialize `SRa`.
5. Identity Manager's engine identifies `Rt`'s navigation rule `Nr` whose condition matches `SRa`
   and/or `Ci`, and associated scalar rules `Sr`.
6. Using `Sr` and `Nr`'s definition, Identity Manager's engine identifies `Tr`'s values to be
   provisioned to materialize `SRa`.

This series of steps is actually a very simplified version of the
[Evaluate Policy](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/index.md) algorithm.
