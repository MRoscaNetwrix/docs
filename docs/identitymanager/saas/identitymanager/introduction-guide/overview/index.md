# IGA and Netwrix Identity Manager

Identity Manager is a powerful tool for Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) automation.

## Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)

Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) is a combination of Identity Access Management (IAM)
and Identity Access Governance (IAG).

- IAM is about allowing the right identities to have the right permissions at the right time for the
  right reasons.
- IAG is about providing visibility regarding identities, user access, and for monitoring
  compliance.

[See Gartner's documentation on IGA](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3885381).

## Why Identity Manager

We could explain Identity Manager's purpose like this:

Typically, Identity Manager manages entitlements automatically according to a user's needs, for
example Active Directory group memberships.

**Then, we need to manage entitlements, in other words access rights, or permissions.**

Identity Manager helps you build a role catalog that lists all entitlements from all managed
systems. The technical entitlements can then associated with new, functional names that more clearly
represent a business-oriented view point.

In addition, Identity Manager helps you determine identities' expected entitlements by building a
role model. This model contains different kinds of rules that will suggest entitlement assignments,
or even assign them directly, based on the imported organizational data.

As each working environment has its own particularities, you will be able to refine the identity
model by defining dimensions, i.e. criteria from among organizational data that will trigger the
rules.
