# On-Premises Environment

When working in an on-premises environment, Identity Manager needs a specific architecture.

## Overview

Identity Manager recommends the following architecture:

Most situations do not need Identity Manager so much that they need a fail-over system, i.e.
installing several Identity Manager instances in order to prevent breakdowns. In most situations, a
single Identity Manager instance is enough.

### Server

The server should be stateless, i.e. it should store only temporary files.

### Agent(s)

One or several additional agents can be needed only when using a sensitive network, for example an
administration network separated from the main network.

### Database

The database is a critical item, and thus should be set up with a mirror. The database mirror can
have lower CPU and RAM and be on a different location.

Identity Manager recommends using an incremental backup.
