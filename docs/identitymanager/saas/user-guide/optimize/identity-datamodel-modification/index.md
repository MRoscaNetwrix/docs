# Modify the Identity Data Model

How to make data model properties evolve according to the organization's needs.

## Overview

The identity data model must contain all the information needed to manage identities and their
permissions, and only the information strictly required for this purpose.

You already considered the data needed for identity management during:

- The initial identities loading and the creation of the identity repository; See the
  [Create the Workforce Repository](/docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/index.md) topic for
  additional information.
- [Model the Data](/docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/index.md)through connector
  modeling which is the analysis phase before connector creation;
- [Create an Entity Type](/docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md) which is the
  technical implementation of the connector model.

The data model established during these steps might change to evolve alongside the needs of the
connected systems, the management strategy, and any change in the organization such as a change of
structure, a new division, etc.

This part is about integrating these changes in the existing data model.

### Dimensions

Identity Manager calls dimensions the attributes that assignment rules rely on. They are essential
criteria that differentiate users in order to give them the appropriate roles. See the
[Conforming Assignments](/docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/conformingassignmentcomputation/index.md)
topic for additional information.

### Personal data security

Only professional data should be used in the identity data model, not personal data.

## Participants and Artifacts

Integrators are able to perform an identity update if they master the new data model.

| Input                                                                    | Output                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Initial identities loading (required) New identity data model (required) | Updated identity data model |

See the [Create the Workforce Repository](/docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/index.md) topic
for additional information.

## Add or Modify Properties

The data model can be updated in the UI via a feature scanning the data model. This scan performs an
analysis on the data previously imported through the Excel file. It detects properties which are
always empty and suggests to remove them from the data model, for clarity purposes.

> For example, some systems don't store phone numbers. Then, scanning the data model will allow
> Identity Manager to suggest removing the property about phone numbers. Note that Identity Manager
> only provides suggestions but makes no decision. You could choose to keep the phone number
> property anyway in order to fill it later.

NETWRIX recommends updating the data model through the scan feature, as this feature is driven by
Identity Manager's suggestions.

However, the identity data model can also be updated through the directory's entity types, following
the previously given
[Create an Entity Type](/docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md).

### Through a data model scan

Add or modify properties within the identity data model by proceeding as follows:

1. On the home page, click on **Settings** in the **Configuration** section.

    ![Home Page - Configuration](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-configuration/home_settings_v523.webp)

2. Access the data model on the **Workforce** > **Data Model** page.
3. Change the display option to show or hide properties in the identity repository.

    ![Scan Data Model - Display Option](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/optimize/identity-datamodel-modification/datamodelmodif_scan_v600.webp)

4. After your changes are complete, click on the Save icon at the top.

    ![Save Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-configuration/iconsave_v602.svg)

5. Click on the **Reload** button to apply the recent changes to the application.

## Delete Properties

Integrators should keep in mind that the fields that they want to delete might be used in connectors
or other places they didn't think about. Existing assignments might be impacted.

Identity Manager suggests the removal only of empty fields. In this case, there is nothing to worry
about.

## Verify Data Model Modification

In order to verify the process:

- Check manually a sample in the user directory accessible from the home page. You should verify at
  least your own sheet and the sheets assigned to your hierarchy.

    ![Home - Directory User](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/configure-workflows/home_directoryuser_v523.webp)

- Check that every organization still has a manager. Organizations are accessible in the department
  directory accessible from the home page.

    ![Home - Directory Department](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/home_directorydepartment_v523.webp)

    ![List of Departments](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/initialload_departments_v602.webp)

    If the system contains numerous organizations, it is also possible to list them with their
    managers through the Query module. See
    the[Generate Reports](/docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/administrate/reporting/index.md) topic for additional information.

- [Generate Reports](/docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/administrate/reporting/index.md) with indicators, for example, on the
  number of workers per type or per organization (through Identity Manager's predefined reports, the
  Query module or Power BI), to ensure that Identity Manager's content sticks to reality.
