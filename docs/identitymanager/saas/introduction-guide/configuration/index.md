# Configuration

There are several options for configuring Identity Manager.

## Application Configuration

### User Interface

Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube) strongly recommends that Identity Manager be
configured, as much as possible, via the UI.

### XML files

For advanced users, if the UI is not enough, Identity Manager can also be configured via XML files.
These XML files should be placed in a `Conf` folder directly inside the working directory.

### Database

Identity Manager's application configuration, whether it is made from the UI or the XML files, is
stored in a database which should never be modified manually.

## Network Configuration

Identity Manager's server and agent(s) are configured via JSON files, mainly `appsettings.json` and
`appsettings.agent.json`.
