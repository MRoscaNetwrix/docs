# Existing Assignments

The
[ Compute Role Model Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/computerolemodeltask/index.md)
can deduce from synchronized data a list of assignments for every identity.

## Overview

One of the main responsibilities of the Compute Role Model task is to translate data from the realm
of the managed systems (such as accounts or groups) into the realm of roles.

The process results in a list of existing assignments, expressed as assigned roles, for every
identity.

This is Identity Manager's first computation when deployed in an organization: assessing the current
state of the managed system in order to suggest fixes.

The main process can be summed up as:

1. Finding the owner `O` of a resource `R` by applying correlation rules.
2. Deducing roles by applying provisioning rules (such as navigation or scalar) "in reverse". In
   this step, Identity Manager tries to find the role that would have yielded a provisioning order
   for resource `R`, if assigned to identity `O`.

The following use cases can be encountered.

## Use Case 1: One Group, One Role

This first use case involves a common role model situation: one single role represents one
entitlement, for example an Active Directory group.

Let's study this use case with an example: a single role _Internet_ is linked to an Active Directory
group _Internet_ through a navigation rule `N`.

![use_case_1_rolemodel](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/role-assignment/existingassignmentsdeduction/use_case_1_rolemodel.webp)

We are going to consider here an identity named John Doe, and his Active Directory account
[john.doe@contoso.com](mailto:john.doe@contoso.com).

The most straightforward way to think about this role model is to consider the direct flow. This
would happen if John Doe's account wasn't a member of the _Internet_ group.

1. Identity Manager performs the first synchronization, and correlates the nominative Active
   Directory account [john.doe@contoso.com](mailto:john.doe@contoso.com) to John Doe.
2. This account is _not_ a member of the AD group _Internet_.
3. A manager assigns the role to John Doe's identity using Identity Manager's UI.
4. The Compute Role Model task applies the navigation rule `N`.
5. A provisioning order for John Doe's Active Directory account becoming a member of the group
   _Internet_ is issued.

This is a typical onboarding scenario for John Doe that happens to start a new job within the
organization after Identity Manager was deployed.

Now, let's consider what happens for John Doe, if he started his job within the company before
Identity Manager was ever deployed.

The initial situation is an identity, John Doe, and a "lonely" Active Directory account,
[john.doe@contoso.com](mailto:john.doe@contoso.com).

This time, Identity Manager performs the "deduction" flow.

Identity Manager performs the first synchronization and tries to correlate accounts with identities.
This results in finding out that John Doe is the owner of the Active Directory account
[john.doe@contoso.com](mailto:john.doe@contoso.com). The synchronization also shows that the
[john.doe@contoso.com](mailto:john.doe@contoso.com) account is a member of the _Internet_ Active
Directory group.

The situation in Identity Manager database at this point is the following.

![use_case_1_sync](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/role-assignment/existingassignmentsdeduction/use_case_1_sync.webp)

Integrators have defined the Internet single role and linked it to the _Internet_ AD group through
the navigation rule `N`.

Now, the Compute Role Model task "studies" the role model: the only rule that assigns the _Internet_
Active Directory group is the navigation rule `N`. By following the rule in reverse, Identity
Manager deduces that the role _Internet_ should _de facto_ be assigned to John Doe, so that the
rules be consistent with the data found in the Active Directory.

The role is now listed under John Doe's assignment list (permissions) in Identity Manager.

![use_case_1_deduction](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/role-assignment/existingassignmentsdeduction/use_case_1_deduction.webp)

## Use Case 2: Several Groups, One Role

This second use case involves another common role model situation: one single role represents two or
more entitlements. The single role is used here to package several Active Directory group
assignments, for example, assignments which are always granted together to perform certain tasks.

For example, let _Sales manager_ be a single role linked to the Active Directory groups _operations_
and _sales_ through two navigation rules `N1` and `N2`.

The "direct" flow here means that if John Doe is assigned the _Sales manager_ role, Identity
Manager fulfills the _operations_ and _sales_ group memberships for John Doe's Active Directory
account.

Now, let's consider the reverse flow. If John Doe already had membership for the _operations_ and
_sales_ group before Identity Manager was deployed, the AD Synchronization will detect it. By
applying `N1` and `N2` in reverse, Identity Manager deduces that John Doe must have the _Sales
manager_ single role.

His trusted advisor, Mary Webster, isn't a member of the _operations_ group. She is only a member of
the _sales_ group. Identity Manager applies `N1` in reverse, but there is only one Single Role
(_Sales manager_) that grants the _sales_ group membership. The only way for Mary to be granted the
_sales_ group membership from the role model point-of-view is to have been granted the _Sales
manager_ role. For Identity Manager, it is as if Mary had been assigned this role, but is missing
the _operations_ group. That is exactly how it is materialized: the identity for Mary in Identity
Manager will be assigned the _Sales manager_ role, and a missing group membership will come up in
the provisioning review screen.

If the IGA administrator doesn't want Mary to be granted the _Sales manager_ role and hence the
_operations_ group, another role must be created, that only grants the _sales_ group but not the
_operations_ group.

## Use Case 3: Several Groups, Several Roles

The third use case is a less common one, but can still be a little confusing.

Let's take two roles `B` and `C`.

- `B` grants membership to two groups: `AD1` and `AD2`.
- `C` grants `AD2` and `AD3`.

This time, if only `AD2` is found for a given user, no deduction can be made.
