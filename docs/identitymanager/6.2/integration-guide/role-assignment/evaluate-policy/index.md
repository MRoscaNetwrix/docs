# Evaluate Policy

Evaluate Policy is the core algorithm of the assignment policy. See the
[Assignment Policy](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/role-model/role-model-rules/index.md) topic for additional information.

The algorithm is applied by the server to a resource. It has the following responsibilities:

- Enforcing the assignment rules: the algorithm outputs a list of expected assignments for the input
  resource
- Evaluating risks
- Managing assignment lifecycle: updating provisioning states
- Purging expired assignments

See the [Risk Management](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/governance/risks/index.md) topic for additional information.

## Overview

![Evaluate Policy Overview](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/evaluate-policy-1.webp)

The main responsibility of the Evaluate Policy is to compute, for every fed resource, the set of
assignments of entitlements that comply with the assignment policy.

That set is composed of roles that should be assigned to the resource and of scalar and navigation
assignments that should exist for that resource as an owner. The latter are in fact values of target
resource properties to fulfill from that resource fed in the algorithm. Those assignments are
referred to as the expected assignments. Manual assignments and derogations are included as well, as
they become rules within the assignment policy.

Evaluate Policy also identifies the existing assignments. They represent the actual assignments read
(or more accurately, deduced) from the managed systems' resources.

Finally, the differences between the existing assignments and the expected assignments are computed.
As a result, a set of non-conforming assignments is revealed, to be fixed by provisioning or
validated as derogations.

Later, provisioning orders are edited, validated by a knowledgeable user and sent to the agent for
connectors to fulfill and fix the differences.

Evaluate Policy is executed by the task `Usercube-Compute-RoleModel`, usually included in a
regularly scheduled provisioning job.

See the [Connectors](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/connectors/index.md),
[Compute Role Model Task](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/computerolemodeltask/index.md),
and [Jobs](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs/index.md) topics for additional information.

## The Algorithm Steps

**Step 1 –** **Select resources** from the resource repository, all the relevant properties for
every resource.

This includes:

- Attribute values of the resource itself;
- Attribute values of the resources pointed to by a navigation property from the current resource;
- All existing assignments for these resources and their properties such as provisioning state and
  workflow state;
- Every property of the source resource, if the resource is a target in an owner/target
  relationship;
- Every property of the target resource, if the resource is an owner in an owner/target
  relationship;

Extracting and computing, in an acceptable amount of time, such a load of data is no trivial matter.

The number of resources to consider is of the order of 100 000 entries for a system managing 10 000
identities among 4 managed systems.

To improve execution time, two optimizations are used:

- Identity Manager uses
  [batching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/performance-improve-use-batching) to
  perform the database request. The `SELECT` query is divided into sets of smaller queries called
  batches. The size of a batch is configurable in the Identity Manager-Compute-RoleModel, with the
  `BatchSelectSize` attribute.
- Identity Manager only selects resources for which a new assignment computation is needed. They are
  resources updated during the last incremental synchronization, and resources that depend on them.
  They are identified by the dirty flag, set during incremental synchronization. See the
  [Upward Data Synchronization](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/synchronization/upward-data-sync/index.md) topic for
  additional information.

:::note
For very few edge cases, dependencies between resource values can be difficult to identify
within Identity Manager. An example involves entity property expressions using
[LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) syntax. See
the [Entity Type](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/metadata/entitytype/index.md)topic for
additional information. A second- or third-order binding used in such an expression actually defines
a dependency. But Identity Manager does not account for it, because of performance-reliability
trade-offs. That means a resource `R1`, using such an expression to compute one of its properties
values from another resource `R2` property value, might not be updated even if `R2` has been updated
by incremental synchronization. This too can be fixed by using complete synchronization once a day.
:::


**Step 2 –** **Compute expected assignments**

The second step is building the expected assignment list by applying the assignment rules to the
input resource.

This step builds a list, from scratch, of every expected assignment, both role assignments and
assignments issued from provisioning rules.

The list contains:

- Automatic assignments, inferred from context-based rules
- Automatic assignments, inferred from other assignments, according to role-based rules
- Manual assignments previously created and derogations previously validated
- Assignments updated by an automation rule. See the
  [Automation Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/automationrule/index.md) topic for
  additional information.

To build the list, the algorithm first goes through composite role rules, single role rules,
resource type rules, navigation rules, and applies them in that order. See the
[Composite Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerolerule/index.md),
[Single Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md), and
[Resource Type](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md) topics for
additional information. This takes care of automatic assignments. Every step influences the
following one: single roles can be inferred from composite roles that have just been assigned by a
reviewer or an automation rule for example.

Then, manual assignments and derogations are added to the expected assignments list. They are
extracted from the database, where they were saved after being added from the UI or validated
through the UI, and are considered part of the role model. Manual assignments are identified by the
Approved workflow state. Derogations are identified by the Found and Historic workflow states.

Role assignments as derogations are displayed to the end-user for confirmation in the Role
Reconciliation screen. As long as they are not denied, they are considered a part of the role model
and will not be considered as a non-conforming difference to be fixed by provisioning. They are
deduced from actual resources and resource values found in the managed system, that do not comply
with the assignment rules, and are displayed in the Resource Reconciliation screen.

Let's detail the rule enforcement mechanisms.

**Match context rules**

Dimensions are really the basis of an assignment process. See the
[Entitlement Management](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/index.md)
topic for additional information.

Before starting, a context rule is applied, giving for the input resource:

- The dimension values
- The time period validity of every assignment computed during this Evaluate Policy iteration

![Computing Context For Input Resource](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/enforce-context.webp)

**Computing expected role assignments**

Role assignments, on the other hand, are the outcome of the assignment process. See the
[Entitlement Management](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/index.md)
topic for additional information.

Role assignments are the output of composite role rules and single role rules enforcement. The
outcome of those rules, as assigned composite roles and assigned single roles, is conditioned by the
input resource's context. They are the image of the status of trust and privilege granted to a
resource-identity.

![Computing Expected Role Assignments](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/compute-expected-1.webp)

**Enforcing composite role rules**

The first rules that are enforced are the composite role rules. See the
[Composite Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerolerule/index.md)topic
for additional information.

For every selected resource, this step enforces composite role rules. That means assigning a
specific composite role to the input resource, based on its context's dimension values. This new
assignment is materialized into a new object called an assigned composite role, stored in the
`UP_AssignedCompositeRoles` table. The resource becomes the owner of the assigned composite role.

Manual and derogatory assignments of composite roles found in the database are also added to the
expected assignments list.

Then automation rules are enforced on assigned composite roles. See the
[Automation Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/automationrule/index.md) topic for
additional information.

:::note
Enforcing automation rules on an assignment means to find, for each assignment, the
matching automation rule, looking at the last review or the creation date, comparing it to the time
defined in the rule and, if needed, apply the rule decision that may approve or decline the
assignment.
:::


**Enforcing single role rules**

Then, single role rules are enforced. That means assigning a specific single role to the input
resource based on its context and existing assigned composite roles, i.e. the composite roles
currently assigned to the resource. Both assigned composite roles freshly created by enforcing
composite role rules and those already in the database are taken into account. In the former case,
single roles created are said to be inferred.

This is materialized into a new object called an assigned single role, stored in the
UP_AssignedSingleRoles table. The resource becomes the owner of the assigned single role.

Manual and derogatory assignments found in the database of single roles are also added to the
expected assignments list.

Then automation rules are enforced on assigned single roles.

**Expected provisioning assignments**

Fulfillment is just the consequence of the role assignment process. See the
[Entitlement Management](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/introduction-guide/overview/entitlement-management/index.md)
topic for additional information.

Provisioning-orders-to-be are the output of resource type rules, navigation rules and scalar rules.
The outcome of those rules, as assigned resource types, assigned resource navigation, and assigned
resource scalar is conditioned by the input resource assigned roles, issued during the first
expected role assignments computation or even earlier. They are the exact image of technical
provisioning orders that are to be executed by the agent, after being validated by a knowledgeable
user. See the [Resource Type](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md)
topic for additional information.

![Computing Expected Provisioning Assignments](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/compute-expected-2.webp)

**Enforcing resource type rules**

Resource type rules are enforced. This means creating and adding assigned resource types to the
expected assignments list. This means enforcing the need for a resource of that type to be created
in the managed systems, with the input resource as its owner.

Then automation rules are enforced on assigned resource types.

A further step will correlate, to find the actual target resource if it exists. If not, it will
eventually become a provisioning order to create such a resource.

This can be seen as assigning a target resource to an owner. It's still important to note that the
act of assigning a resource to an owner almost always is the consequence of a role assignment. Use
cases for which a single, isolated resource, is "assigned" (i.e. created with specific values) is
rare and is more of a solution to a specific technical problem.

**Enforcing navigation rules**

Finally, navigation rules are enforced. They aim to complete the information about the resource to
be created because of the assigned resource types. If the type rule is the what, this is the how.

For every assigned resource type, associated navigation rules are enforced.

Navigation rules are conditioned on the resource's assigned single roles. If a specific single role
is found as assigned to the owner resource of the assigned resource type (i.e. the input resource of
the algorithm), an assigned resource navigation is created in the UP_AssignedResourceNavigation
table, with the resource as its owner. The assigned resource navigation will eventually translate
into a provisioning order.

The assigned resource navigation is hence the consequence, in the form of a
provisioning-order-to-be, of assigning a role to a resource.

This means also no assigned resource type, no navigation assignment. Resource type rules are a
prerequisite for the associated navigation rules to be enforced.

**Enforcing scalar rules**

Finally, the scalar rules associated with the target's resource type are enforced and become
assigned resource scalars that will also result in a provisioning order.

For every assigned resource type, associated scalar rules are enforced.

They also aim to complete the information about the resource to be created because of the assigned
resource types.

Found manual assignments and derogation of resource types with their associated navigation and
scalar assignments are added as well.

**Step 3 –** **Match existing assignments with expected assignments**

![Computing Expected Provisioning Assignments](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/compute-find-matching.webp)

The expected assignments list is now built.

For every expected/computed assigned resource type, assigned single role and assigned composite
role, the algorithm finds the matching existing assignment, from the list of assignments.

The existing list of assignments in the current database is composed of:

- Assignments computed by the last Evaluate Policy;
- Assignments created by the classification task, including `Found` and `Historic` ones issued from
  the analysis of the resource values from the managed system.

The result is a list of expected assignments that have a counterpart in the list of existing
assignments.

**Step 4 –** **Assignments cleansing / purge**

Some assignments are given an expiration date at creation (see the first step, context rules
enforcement). This is the step where expired assignments are removed from the expected assignments
list.

They will not be deleted, but historized. The validTo column of the UP_Assigned\* is updated.

Others have been manually denied via the provisioning review screen, or must be canceled because of
rules or resource value changes. Those are deleted too.

The result is a list of really existing assignments, without the expired, canceled or explicitly
unwanted ones for any reason.

**Step 5 –** **Correlation**

![Computing Expected Provisioning Assignments](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/correlation.webp)

Resource correlation rules are enforced: for every expected assigned resource type, the algorithm
looks for a target resource that correlates the owner, which is the input resource.

If found, that correlated resource becomes the target of the assigned resource type. If not, a
provisioning order of creation is written.

A word about correlation. Correlation is achieved by using resource correlation rules. Each rule
applies to a resource type. It defines for the source entity type a quantity computed from its
attributes. It does the same for the target entity types. Those quantities are called correlation
keys. For a given assigned resource type, the correlation algorithm tries to match the owner
correlation key with all available resources of entity type target. If one is found equal, the
matching resource becomes target of said assigned resource type. For every resource, correlation
keys are computed by a regularly scheduled task and stored in the database.

**Step 6 –** **Handle assignment lifecycle**

Expected assigned resource scalars and assigned resource navigations matching existing counterparts
are found.

For every assigned resource type, assigned resource scalar and assigned resource navigation, the
provisioning state is updated according to the correlated target resource values, the matching
existing assignment state and the provisioning state transition algorithm.

For expected assignments that have a matching existing counterpart, the correlated target resource
values are analyzed. If they match the expected resource values, that means that the last
provisioning order has been indeed well executed. The provisioning state of the associated
assignment is switched to Applied. Same goes for the role assignments from which those scalar and
navigation assignments originated.

For expected assignments that do not have a matching existing counterpart, they receive their
Pending or Blocked provisioning state.

Blocked assignments are submitted for validation in the provisioning review screen. Blocked assigned
resource types are associated with a confidence level that describes the level of confidence of the
correlation between source and target. The confidence level is a configuration of the resource
correlation rules.

The workflow state is also analyzed; assignments with Approved (or Cancellation) have been approved
(or denied) and can now be provisioned.

**Step 7 –** **Delta**

The existing and expected assignment lists are compared and yield a third list of differences, i.e.
non conforming values in the managed systems that need to be fixed.

That list will eventually become provisioning orders that will be sent to the agent for fulfillment.

**What constitutes a difference?**

Expected resource and their values not matching the existing resource and their value, for an
existing assignment with an `Applied` or `Executed` provisioning state.

If the existing assignment is not yet `Applied` the agent might still be preparing the provisioning.
A resource value that does not comply with the role model, but is in the fixing process (meaning an
assignment with a provisioning state of `Pending` or `Sent`) will not come up in the UI.

**Step 8 –** **Saving the result**

At this point, Evaluate Policy has computed expected assignments for the resource, by applying rules
and purging expired assignments.

Expected assignments are:

- Assigned composite roles and assigned single roles, representing roles assigned to the resource
- Assigned resource scalars and assigned resource navigations, representing scalar and navigation
  properties to fulfill to a target resource from that source resource, the ownership relationship
  between source and target being materialized by an assigned resource type.

Expected assigned are written to the database, they will be the basis for the next step: fixing
differences. The writing is optimized by using bulk insert methods.

To enhance the writing performances, it's not actual assigned\* that are written, but updates from
the existing ones, using the delta computed at step 7.

For fine-grained assignments such as assigned resource scalars and assigned resource navigations,
Identity Manager stores the policy value i.e. the value computed by Evaluate Policy (not yet
fulfilled) and the current value i.e. the value currently held by the target resource in the managed
systems.

From there, it is possible to retrieve the differences between existing and expected assignments for
that resource, at any time.

Remember, the goal of building a set of assignments is twofold:

- Building a catalog of existing assignments as assigned roles for non-technical users to consult.
- Fulfill target values from source resources so as the managed systems comply with the role model.

The catalog of existing assignments is now available: they are assigned\* with an Applied
provisioning state. Non technical-users can read assigned single roles and assigned composite roles.
Technical users will be more interested in assigned resource scalars and assigned resource
navigations.

Fulfilling target values from source resources is going to take the form of provisioning orders,
computed from assigned resource scalars and navigations in the Pending or Blocked state.

## Fixing Differences

The engine has computed a list of expected assignments. The difference with the managed system
state, as a list of resource values that infer differences in role assignments, can be fixed by
provisioning the expected assignments to the managed systems.

Some provisioning orders have to be reviewed by a knowledgeable user. Those are provisioning orders
computed from assigned\* with a Blocked provisioning state. The UI provides screens to perform
review and validation.

Every provisioning order is to fix a difference that has been caused by a change in the source
resource values or in its target resources.

Let's see in details what kind of differences Identity Manager deals with, and what kind of change
in the managed systems triggers them.

The workflow state of an assignment helps identify the nature of a difference between that
assignment and the managed systems.

### UI overview

Differences are displayed in the following screens:

- **Provisioning Review** displays `Blocked` (non `Found`, non `Historic`) assigned resource types,
  assigned resource navigations and assigned resource scalars. They must be reviewed by a
  knowledgeable technical end-user. They are assignments mirroring legit provisioning orders
  recently computed by the Evaluate Policy.
- **Resource Reconciliation** displays `Found` and `Historic` assigned resource types, assigned
  resource navigations and assigned resource scalars. This is where non-conforming resource values
  or non-authorized accounts (i.e. a resource that should not exist at all) in the form of
  provisioning assignments are displayed. These assignments mirror, at the resource value level,
  derogations still not explicitly refused by a knowledgeable end-user. This is where an end-user
  can find provisioning assignments that would render legit the non-confirming values and
  non-authorized accounts found in the managed systems.
- **Role Reconciliation** displays `Found` and `Historic` assigned single roles and assigned
  composite roles. They are role assignments that mirror derogations, at the role level, still not
  explicitly refused by a knowledgeable end-user. This is where an end-user can find roles
  assignments that would render legit the non-confirming values and non-authorized accounts found in
  the managed systems.
- **Redundant Assignments** displays `Approved` assigned roles and assigned resource types tagged as
  eligible to be turned into `Calculated`.

:::tip
Remember, **Role Review** is a little bit different as it displays manually requested assignments
waiting for manual approval.

### A target value to update

A target resource scalar value is different from the scalar value obtained by applying scalar rules
to the source resource.

This could be caused by a change in the target value directly from within the managed system, before
or after Identity Manager has been plugged in. For example, a target Active Directory account Email
value has been changed.

The corresponding assigned\* would be awarded a workflow state Historic or Found given the
difference is about a change in the target made outside/before Identity Manager and found by
synchronization.

As Identity Manager does not overwrite managed systems values without confirmation from a
knowledgeable user, the found non-conforming value will be displayed in the **Resource
Reconciliation** screen, with the suggestion for update. The non-conforming value can either be
kept, and become an exception and overwritten with the rules-issued value.

This could also be caused by a change in the source resource, by a previous fulfillment of Identity
Manager, or directly from within the managed system. For example, the HR system has updated the Name
of an employee. Synchronization has detected the change in value, and reapplied rules. And now, the
target Active Directory account name has to be updated.

The corresponding assigned\* would be awarded a workflow state PolicyApproved given the difference
is about a change in the source that caused the need for a change in the target because of the
applications of the rules.

This case yields a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the
**Provisioning Review** screen for validation in the form of a resource update provisioning order.

### A target resource to create

A target resource is missing. Applying navigation rules to a source resource yielded the need for a
specific target resource that has not been found by synchronization.

This could be caused by a missing resource in a managed system even before Identity Manager was
plugged-in or the deletion of such a resource in the managed system afterward. For example, a
nominative Active Directory account has not been created yet for that existing identity.

The corresponding assigned\* would be awarded a workflow state Historic or Found given the
difference is about a change or an omission in the target outside/before Identity Manager and found
by synchronization.

This case yields a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the
**Provisioning Review** screen for validation in the form of a missing resource provisioning order.

This could also be caused by a change in the source resource, by a previous fulfillment of Identity
Manager, or directly from within the managed system. For example, the HR system has updated the Job
Title of an employee. Synchronization has detected it, and reapplied rules, and now, this identity
has to be awarded a new Active Directory account with higher privileges.

Or it could be caused by the manual assignment of a new Role from within Identity Manager to an
existing identity that would grant that identity with a new account and hence a target resource to
create.

The corresponding assigned\* would be awarded a workflow state `PolicyApproved` given the difference
is about a change in the source that caused the need to create a new target because of the
applications of the rules.

Those cases yield a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the
**Provisioning Review** screen for validation in the form of a resource creation provisioning order.

### A target resource to delete

An extra target resource has been found by synchronization, it's been correlated with our source
resource, but no navigation rules applied to the source resource yielded the need for its existence.

This could be caused by an extra resource created directly from within a managed system, or the
change of a rule that makes some existing resources moot. For example, an administration Active
Directory account has been created directly from the managed system and granted to an identity who,
according to the rules, is not entitled to it.

As Identity Manager does not overwrite managed systems values without confirmation from a
knowledgeable user, the found non-authorized account will be displayed in the **Resource
Reconciliation** screen, with the suggestion for deletion. The non-authorized account can either be
kept, and become an exception and or be deleted to comply with the rules.

The corresponding assigned\* would be awarded a workflow state `Historic` or `Found` given the
difference is about an extra target added outside/before Identity Manager and found by
synchronization.

This could also be cause by a change in the source resource, by a previous fulfillment of Identity
Manager, or directly from within the managed system. For example, the HR system has updated the
`Job Title` of an employee. Synchronization has detected it, and reapplied rules, and now, this
identity has to be awarded a new Active Directory account with lower privileges, the old one must be
deleted.

Or it could be caused by explicitly denying a Role to an existing identity from within Identity
Manager which would ripple through and forbid this account from existing.

The corresponding assigned\* would be awarded a workflow state `PolicyApproved` given the difference
is about a change in the source that caused the need to deletion a target because of the
applications of the rules.

This case yields a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the
**Provisioning Review** screen for validation in the form of a resource deletion provisioning order.

Provisioning orders are still fairly technical to read. Non compliant-roles, inferred from
non-compliant resources in the managed systems, are also displayed in the **Role Reconciliation**
screen to be kept or deleted by less technical users.

## Fulfilling

Fulfilling assignments is the role of connectors. Provisioning orders are written and sent to the
agent via the `Usercube-Generate-ProvisioningOrders` task is added to every provisioning job.
