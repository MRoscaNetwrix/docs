- The permission's recipient will receive a notification email.

    :::note
    In order to receive the notifications, a profile must have the full permission path.
    Having a (great-)parent permission will not enable notifications for all child entities.
    :::


    For example, the permission /ProvisioningPolicy/PerformManualProvisioning/Directory_User allows
    a profile to perform manual provisioning with Directory_User as the source entity type, and
    receive the corresponding notifications. On the contrary, the permission
    /ProvisioningPolicy/PerformManualProvisioning/ allows a profile to perform manual provisioning
    for all entity types, but not receive the corresponding notifications.  
     Each permission can be configured in an access control entry so that the corresponding
    notification is disabled. See the
    [Access Control Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/index.md)topic
    for additional information.
