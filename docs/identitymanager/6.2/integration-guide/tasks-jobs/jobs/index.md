# Jobs

A job is a succession of tasks, to be launched and potentially scheduled, which orchestrate together
the executable files that perform IGA actions.

## Anatomy of a Job

Jobs are used to write sets of successive tasks, and schedule their execution.

See how to configure [ Job ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/job/index.md).

A job can contain tasks explicitly, or contain steps used to call existing tasks in order to use a
single task in several jobs.

## Execution

Jobs are executed by agents.

The agent initiates the job and executes the agent-side tasks. Hence, the agent must have access to
the relevant managed systems. The agent orders the execution of the server-side tasks, complying
with the one-way data flow principle.

A job can be triggered:

- Once manually, through the **Job Execution** screen;
- Once manually, using Usercube-Invoke-Job.exe;
- Periodically, with Identity Manager's internal scheduler `CronTabExpression`;
- Periodically, with an external Scheduler such as
  [Windows Task Scheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page).

## Monitoring

Any job execution is logged into the UJ_JobInstances table.

They can be monitored through the UI, via the **Job Execution** page.
