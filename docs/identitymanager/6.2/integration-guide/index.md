# Integration Guide

This guide is designed to provide the tools and knowledge to fully understand and configure Identity
Manager to match your project's needs.

## Target Audience

This guide is meant to be read by integrators who configure Identity Manager to match their
project's needs.

## Prior Knowledge

A basic knowledge of Identity and Access Management (IAM) and more precisely of Identity and
Governance Administration (IGA) is required to really understand, implement and use Identity
Manager's features.

Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube)strongly recommends starting from the
[Introduction Guide](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/introduction-guide/index.md) to fully benefit from the Integration Guide's
content.

### Technical skills

As Identity Manager is a web application, some classic devops skills are needed:

- Web servers, especially IIS: declare a web site; configure an application pool.
- SQL Server: query data in the database with SQL, including with joins; insert/update data with
  SQL; for advanced use, an understanding of database indexes.
- Coding: very basic C# skills; PowerShell scripts.
- XML and JSON syntax for configuration files.
- Git or other source control tools.

The other technical skills greatly depend on the connectors needed for your projects. The most
frequent ones are:

- Excel and CSV
- LDAP and Active Directory: understanding of LDAP attributes and of group membership.
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)
- Exchange
- REST API programming
