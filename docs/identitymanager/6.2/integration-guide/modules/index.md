# Modules

Identity ManagerÂ can integrate with other software for issues such as credential protection and
logging. To use these integration modules, they just need to be configured in Identity Manager's
`appsettings.json` file. Below is more module-specific information.

## Credentials Protection

- [Azure Key Vault](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/azure-key-vault/index.md)
- [CyberArk's AAM Credential Providers ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/cyberark-application-access-manager-credential-providers/index.md)

## Logging
