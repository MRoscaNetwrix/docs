# Composite Role

Defines basic information about a composite role. Composite roles identify affiliations or job
functions by which users can be grouped. A composite role is a business role comprehensible by
managers. It provides a layer of abstraction above existing entitlements, technical roles and single
roles.

Roles can be used to:

- Grant various types and levels of access.
- Restrict access to sensitive information assets by grouping entitlements in a form that is
  meaningful to the business.
- Grant the minimum privileges required by an individual to perform their job.

Roles can be requested manually, or they can be configured to be assigned automatically via a
[Composite Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerolerule/index.md). To further control access, roles can be
related via required, inherited, or permitted relationships.

## Examples

The following example declares a new composite role.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```

**<CompositeRole Identifier="HR_Accounting" DisplayName_L1="HR:accounting" Category="HR" ApprovalWorkflowType="One" EntityType="Directory_User" Policy="Default"/>**

```

| MaxDuration optional                                                                       | Int32                                          | Duration (in minutes) after which the role will be automatically revoked, if no earlier end date is specified. It impacts only the roles which are manually assigned after the maximum duration is set. Pre-assigned roles are not impacted. If no duration is set on the role, the `MaxDuration` of the associated policy is applied. If the `MaxDuration` is set to 0 on the role, it prevents the associated policy from applying its `MaxDuration` to it.                                                                        |
