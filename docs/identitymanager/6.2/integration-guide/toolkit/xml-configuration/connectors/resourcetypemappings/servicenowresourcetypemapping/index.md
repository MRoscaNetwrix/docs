# Service Now Resource Type Mapping

Any resource type mapping must be configured with the same identifier as the related resource type.

Any resource type linked to a ServiceNow connection must be configured with a set of parameters to
map the properties in Identity Manager with those in ServiceNow, for provisioning purposes.

Below is an example of an incident ticket in ServiceNow, where relevant properties (from Identity
Manager's perspective) are emphasized:

## Examples

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ServiceNowResourceTypeMapping Identifier="ServiceNow_Entry_NominativeUser" Connection="ServiceNowExportFulfillment" PasswordResetSetting="ToSelf" DefaultObjectClass="sys_user">
  <Property Property="sys_id" IsDNProperty="true" />
</ServiceNowResourceTypeMapping>
```
