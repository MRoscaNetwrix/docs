    Update risk score with the risk settings.

- [ Compute Role Model Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/computerolemodeltask/index.md)

    Retrieves provisioning orders from the informed connector generated by
    GenerateProvisioningOrdersTask to make changes in a system. Instead of a connector it is

    Takes as input an SQL file or an SQL command to output several CSV files that can be used by the
    collection.

- [ Maintain Indexes Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/maintainindexestask/index.md)

    Index maintenance and statistics update for all database tables.

- [ Manage Configuration Indexes Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/manageconfigurationindexestask/index.md)

- [ Process Access Certification Items Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/processaccesscertificationitemstask/index.md)

    Process decisions on access certification items.

- [ Reset Valid From Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/resetvalidfromtask/index.md)

    Initialize historization tables by setting each entity's first record `ValidFrom` value to
    0001-01-01 00:00:00.00.

- [ Save Pre-Existing Access Rights Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/savepreexistingaccessrightstask/index.md)

- [ Send Access Certification Notification Task ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/sendaccesscertificationnotificationtask/index.md)
