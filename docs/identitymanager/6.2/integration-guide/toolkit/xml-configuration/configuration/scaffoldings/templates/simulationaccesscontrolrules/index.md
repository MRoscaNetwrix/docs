# Simulation Access Control Rules

This scaffolding generates the rights to configure and launch simulations.

It also gives access to a shortcut on the dashboard allowing to enter the simulation screen. Through
this screen, simulations can be launched and results can be visualized.

The scaffolding generates the following scaffoldings:

- [Policy Simulation Control Rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/accesscontrolrules/simulations/policysimulationcontrolrules/index.md):
- [Role And Simulation Control Rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/accesscontrolrules/simulations/roleandsimulationcontrolrules/index.md):

## Examples

```

  <SimulationAccessControlRules Profile="Administrator"/>

```
