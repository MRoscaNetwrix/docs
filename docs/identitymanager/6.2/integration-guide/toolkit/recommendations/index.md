# Recommendations

## Editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended editor for configuration.
Its extensions can highly benefit the configuration experience. Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly
Usercube) recommends the following extensions:

- [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)
  for file organization;
- [Xml Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DotJoshJohnson.xml) for XML
  formatting;
- [XML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rogalmic.vscode-xml-complete) by RedHat
  to provide auto-completion of XML configuration based on an XSD file;
- [Powershell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) for
  Powershell formatting;
- [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) for CSV
  formatting;
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) for file history
  features.

### Configure auto-completion

RedHat's XML extension provides auto-completion based on an XSD file. It opens an auto-completion
popup when you start to edit an element or attribute name. You can open the popup by typing
`Ctrl-Space`.

Configure auto-completion by proceeding as follows:

1. Retrieve from the SDK artifact the `usercube-configuration.xsd` and
   `Usercube.Demo.code-workspace` files.
2. Make sure that these files are in the working directory (for example `C:/identitymanagerDemo`).
3. In `Usercube.Demo.code-workspace`, declare the following setting, replacing the path
   `C:/identitymanagerDemo/identitymanager-configuration.xsd` by the path of your XSD file:

    ```

        "settings": {
            "xml.fileAssociations": [
                {
                    "systemId": "file:///C:/identitymanagerDemo/identitymanager-configuration.xsd",
                    "pattern": "**/*.xml"
                }
            ]
        }

    ```

## Version Control System

A version control system (like Git) is also recommended so files and configuration history could be
tracked.

## File Hierarchy

Some folders in the XML configuration contain files that are generated by Identity Manager and that
must not be modified manually:

- `Runtime/Workforce`
- `Runtime/Bootstrap`

For the configuration to be more readable it is recommended to classify configuration by Connector
or Application Entity. For each Connector or Application Entity create a folder in which will put:

- **_Connector.xml_** file containing the definition of the Connector, the EntityTypes,the
  EntityAssociations and their mappings.
- **_Administrator.xml_** file containing all the ACE for the administrator profile.
- **_Role Model.xml_** file containing the role model configuration.
- **_UI.xml_** file containing the User Interface configuration.
- **_Jobs.xml_** file containing the jobs configuration.
- **_Workflows.xml_** file containing the Workflows configuration for the given connector.
