# Create the Connector

How to declare the technical container of a
[ Connector ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connector/index.md).

## Overview

Here, you will learn how to create a connector: the shell that harbors entity types and connections
related to a single managed system.

Keep in mind that a Identity Manager installation can have more than one agent. Connectors should be
created with a specific agent in mind since the agent needs to physically connect to the managed
system's data. Fortunately, you don't need to worry about that right now, since you are starting
with the agent provided with Identity Manager's SaaS environment. See the
[ Architecture ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/introduction-guide/architecture/index.md) topic for additional
information.

## Participants and Artifacts

For a given managed system, integrators may need the help of the application owner who knows the
purpose of the application.

## Create a Connector Container

Create a connector container by proceeding as follows:

1. On the home page in the **Configuration** section, click on the **Connectors** button.

    ![Home page - Connectors](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/synchronization/home_connectors_v602.webp)

    You will see all existing connectors.

2. Click on the addition icon and fill in the information fields.

    - `Identifier`: must be unique among connectors, without any whitespace, start with a letter,
      and contain only letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`.
    - `Name`: will be displayed in the UI to identify the connector.
    - `Agent`: agent that the connector is supposed to use.

        Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube)recommends choosing the provided SaaS agent.

    - `Complete Job`: [ Jobs ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs/index.md) scheduled to
      perform a set of tasks, including completesynchronization and/or provisioning for all the
      connectors, for which you selected the corresponding checkbox.
    - `Incremental Job`: [ Jobs ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs/index.md) scheduled
      to perform frequently a set of tasks, including incrementalsynchronization and/or provisioning
      for all the connectors, for which you selected the corresponding checkbox.

3. Click on **+ Create** to get on the connector's overview page:

## Verify the Connector Declaration

In order to verify the process, check that the connector has been added to the connectors list with
the right name and identifier.
