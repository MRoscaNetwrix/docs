# Create a Connection

How to create a
[ Connection ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connection/index.md)
inside a
[ Connector ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connector/index.md)
and choose the appropriate package.

## Overview

A connection is the information that allows to connect to a managed system, which includes
credentials and path.

There is a minimum of one connection per connector. In many cases, there is one connection
to[ Synchronize Data ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/synchronization/index.md)and one connection for
[Provision](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/administrate/provisioning/index.md).

A connection is associated with a package, representing the technology to use for the data transfer.

## Participants and Artifacts

For a given managed system, integrators may need the help of the application owner who knows the
purpose of the application.

See the [ Create the Connector ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-declaration/index.md) and
[ Model the Data ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/index.md) topics for additional information.

## Create a Connection

Create a connection by proceeding as follows:

1. Click on the addition button in the **Connections** frame on the connector's summary page.

    ![Add a New Connection](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connection_newconnection_v602.webp)

2. Fill in the connection information fields on the left, then select a package (AD, CSV, etc.) and
   fill the associated agent settings on the right.

    ![Connection Creation](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connectioncreation_connectioncreation_v602.webp)

    - `Identifier`: must be unique among connections, without any whitespace, start with a letter,
      and contain only letters, numbers, `.` and/or `-`.
    - `Name`: will be displayed in the UI to identify the connection.
    - `Package`: the technology that enables the connection. Choose the package that fits best the
      managed system. See details below.
    - `Agent Settings`: depends on the selected package.

    Then click on **Create & Close**.

### Select a package

A package is chosen according to the following constraints:

- What kind of technologies do we need?

    > An Active Directory, a plain CSV file, etc.

- Do we need incremental or complete synchronizations, or both?

    Incremental synchronizations, usually launched approximately every two hours, are to be
    performed for real-time needs, while complete synchronizations, scheduled no more than once a
    day, will recover any changes that may have slipped through the cracks of the incremental
    synchronizations. See the
    [ Upward Data Synchronization ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/synchronization/upward-data-sync/index.md)
    topic for additional information.

- Do we need [Provision](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/administrate/provisioning/index.md)? If so, should provisioning be
  performed manually or automatically by Identity Manager?

NETWRIX recommends starting by creating a connector that only does synchronization, and do not worry
yet about provisioning. It allows Identity Manager to read data from your managed system, without
writing to the system.

One connector can contain several connections, and each connection contains one package.

> For example, an `AD` connector, that will handle synchronization and provisioning between Identity
> ManagerÂ and an AD, would generally use the `Directory/Active Directory` package which can do
> synchronization and automated provisioning. A second package for manual provisioning,
> `Ticket/Usercube` could be added to request manual provisioning of administration accounts that
> need more security.

Each type of package needs its own settings, and secured options can be used to store sensitive
connection information. See the
[Connections](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/connectors/configuration-details/connections/index.md)
topic for additional information.

## Refresh Schemas

A schema is a snapshot of the data structure (metadata) retrieved by a connection. It needs to be
refreshed to enable the configuration of entity types and resource types.

Identity Manager refreshes a connection's schema:

- after the connection creation;
- when clicking on **Refresh Schema** on the connection's page: only the schema of the current
  connection is refreshed;

    ![Refresh Schema of One Connection](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connectioncreation_refreshschema_v522.webp)

- when clicking on **Refresh all schemas** on the connector's page: all schemas of the connector are
  refreshed.

    ![Refresh all Schemas](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connectioncreation_refreshall_v602.webp)

In the **Connections** frame, either the last successful schema update is indicated or an icon is
shown if the refresh schema failed.

![Failed Refresh Schemas](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connectioncreation_failedindicator_v602.webp)

Some packages don't generate a schema. For these packages, the **Refresh Schema** button isn't
displayed on the connection's page. On the connector's page, a connection without schema is
indicated by the sentence "_There is no schema for this connection_".

![No Schema](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connectioncreation_noschema_v522.webp)

The connections' schemas must be refreshed before editing the connector's entity types via the UI,
whether the connections were created via the UI or XML configuration. Otherwise, there will be no
connection table available in the `Source` dropdown, so you will not be able to save anything.

## Impact of Modifications

Changes on a connection may imply changes in the connector's entity types. When a connection schema
changes, a warning may appear in the entity type screen indicating that a mapped property doesn't
exist anymore.

## Verify the Connection

In order to verify the process:

1. click on **Check Connection** to ensure that Identity Manager can reach the managed system;

    ![Check Connection](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connectioncreation_checkconnection_v602.webp)

    Some connectors have both incremental and complete setting modes. See the
    [ Jobs ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/tasks-jobs/jobs/index.md)topic for additional
    information. They are relatively independent so they both need to be tested.

2. check that the connection appears in the **Connections** frame with the right options, and
   without the Failed icon.

![Decline Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/certifcampaign_icondecline_v522.svg)

## Troubleshooting

If the Failed icon appears, then:

![Decline Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/certifcampaign_icondecline_v522.svg)

Ensure that the schema of the connection is refreshed.

If the schema couldn't be recovered, then:

![Schema Not Recovered](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/connection_notrecovered_v523.webp)

- Ensure that the managed system is properly connected.
- Check the connection's settings.

    > Example: For a CSV connection, ensure that the file paths are written correctly in full, such
    > as `C:/UsercubeDemo/Sources/Directory.xlsx`.

You may have a schema that could not be recovered if you work with a system without a direct access
to the agent. In this case, schema refreshment will fail but that does not mean that there
necessarily is a problem.

Try again from a system that can access the agent.
