# Model the Data

How to choose the appropriate model for a connector's data.

## Overview

In this part, you work outside Identity Manager to define the model that is going to be used in the
next steps to represent a managed system's resources and entitlements inside Identity Manager, as a
connector.

This page is no technical procedure, but rather a guide aiming to give a global view on connectors
(with their components and their purpose), in order to help integrators choose the most appropriate
way to model the managed system in the form of a connector later inside Identity Manager.

The aim is to think about said managed system in order to specify:

- what data you need to import into Identity Manager;
- how you are going to organize this data together, and model it as a connector inside Identity
  Manager.

### Useful data

Modeling the connector is a matter of identifying what data you want to get into Identity Manager.
You should not retrieve all the data from the managed system, but only two kinds of useful data:

1. data that represents how the authorization system works in the managed system, i.e. data that
   composes entitlements and their assignments;
2. data that you want to watch and/or control and/or fulfill.

The model must take both into account. So both kinds of data must be extracted from the managed
system.

> Let's take an example. An Active Directory manages authorization through group membership (using
> the user-group paradigm).
>
> So first we need to retrieve both groups and accounts, in order to manage the AD's assignments of
> entitlements for our users (in the AD language: manage their accounts and group memberships).
>
> Secondly, we want to control attributes such as the name or e-mail of the account, and ensure they
> are consistent with the correlated identity. Thus these attributes are the second kind of
> information that we want to retrieve.

### Data models

Fortunately, you won't have to design your connector model from scratch. NETWRIX has done a little
work ahead, and you are presented here with four model templates that have proven to work so far.
Experience shows that most managed systems can be shaped using one or a mix of the following:

- the User model is the most simple model for a connector, where a user is directly associated with
  a list of entitlements;
- the User-Group model represents typical
  [Role-Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) mechanisms,
  where the ability to perform an action is granted through accounts' membership to a specific group
  (also called role or profile according to the system);
- the Account-Profile-Transaction model represents a system, where the ability to perform an action
  is granted through the assignment of fine-grained entitlements (called transactions) which are
  packaged into profiles;
- the Star model represents a system, where the ability to perform an action is granted through the
  assignment of entitlements which are based on at least two variable parameters.

Each template presents a few objects and the relationships between them. To become the model of the
actual managed system, these objects must be renamed and their attributes defined according to the
reality of said managed system.

This sheet guides you through choosing the right model template for your connector. The actual
technical implementation of the model will be tackled in the last part of the connector
configuration: [Create an Entity Type](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md).

**Connector model and roles:**

The design of a model must take into account what is really going on inside the managed system in
terms of entitlements, and be flexible enough to express it as roles in the context of the role
model. The role model is the universal RBAC/ABAC language used by Identity Manager to express all
entitlements.

You don't have to worry about this "role" part right now. It is going to be tackled during single
role catalog creation. At this point, you will take a look at the way roles are defined and linked
to resources to represent entitlements. But the work starts here, by modeling the resources that
exist in the managed system. Some of those resources, such as Active Directory groups, include
interesting information about entitlements.

Right now, you can see the connector's model as a precise description of the shape of the technical
resources and entitlements of the managed system. And, you can see roles as the higher-order
universal language in which entitlements and their assignments are expressed in Identity Manager for
all managed systems.

**Connector model and provisioning**:

After defining the useful data that you need to model a given system, you also have to decide what
data you need Identity Manager to write to the managed system. Identity Manager writing to an
external system is called provisioning.

## Participants and Artifacts

For a given managed system, integrators may need the help of the application owner who knows the
purpose of the application.

## Define the Connector Model

Define your connector model by proceeding as follows:

1. Use the advice and examples given about each model template to find the template that most
   closely matches your use case.
2. Adapt the template to the reality of your managed system by renaming and adjusting the model's
   objects.
3. Define your useful data, and thus the attributes of each object according to the reality of the
   data in your managed system.
4. Ensure that all objects have at least one attribute that can serve as a key to be uniquely
   identified within Identity Manager. You will get more details about keys during entity type
   creation.
5. Ensure the following guidelines' enforcement:

    **Keep it simple**

    The model must stay as simple as possible. Embed just enough information.

    **Keep it readable for most users**

    The model must be easy to understand. For this, adopt a business approach, i.e. make the model
    user-friendly and close to real activities. This functional approach is essential to the
    efficiency of data flows (synchronization/provisioning loop). Keep in mind that the aim is to
    define a model close to the reality of the system.

    **Keep it open to changes**

    The model is going to change and evolve during the life of the application, to account for new
    needs or changes. This must be considered too in the initial model to make future changes less
    painful.

## Model Templates

All templates are detailed with examples and schemas with the following key:

![Schemas' Key](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_key.webp)

During the technical modeling inside Identity Manager, these objects will become entity types, their
attributes will become scalar properties, the links between them will become navigation properties.

### User

#### Authorization mechanisms

The User template is the most simple model for a connector, and used to represent a user directly
associated with a list of entitlements.

Users are represented by the accounts they own, and entitlements are represented by resources.

Permissions can be managed:

- by resource, with a list of authorized accounts for each resource;
- by account, with a list of authorized resources for each account.

#### Model

![User Model](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_user.webp)

Thus you need to create one entity type to represent either accounts or other resources.

Each entity type needs to be shaped with properties, chosen according to the data useful for
entitlement assignment.

The only sensitive and required properties are the keys and the property holding entitlements. It
means that:

- if entitlements are managed by resource, then the entity type representing resources must have an
  attribute (scalar property) containing the list of authorized accounts;
- if entitlements are managed by account, then the entity type representing accounts must have an
  attribute (scalar property) containing the list of authorized resources.

**Recommendation: categorize accounts in types**

Some of the managed systems following this model offer predefined types of accounts, with a
pre-packaged set of authorizations (such as the `basic` user with read/write permissions on
non-sensitive resources, or the `admin` with higher privileges).

Account types make modeling easier, as they bring another level of information about the
entitlements they contain. So we can embed more useful information in the model, thanks to an
attribute that represents the account type.

In further steps, you will be able to define one resource type per account type and map each one to
a role for assignment and provisioning.

#### Example - Canteen badges

Canteen badges are a simple system handled with the User model. Indeed users can simply have among
their attributes the access authorization for a given building and a given time. Or also, instead of
creating an entity type for users, we can create an entity type for the badges. They would have in
their attributes their respective access location and time, and an attribute listing authorized
users.

![User Model - Canteen Badges Example](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_user-canteen.webp)

#### Example - Mailboxes

Mailboxes constitute a complex system, but IGA purposes require little information (only accounts)
so this system can too be handled with the User model, either through users and their entitlement
lists, or through mailbox entitlements and their lists of authorized users.

![User Model - Mailboxes Example](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_user-mailbox.webp)

### User-Group

#### Authorization mechanisms

The User-Group template is better suited to represent typical Role-Based Access Control
authorization mechanisms, where a user is authorized to perform an action according to their
account's membership to a specific group. Instead of groups, some systems talk about roles or
profiles: users are authorized to perform an action through a given role or profile which they are
assigned, instead of a group membership. It is all the same idea, and the User-Group template is
perfect for them too.

Groups can also be categorized and grouped into larger groups.

Users are represented by the accounts they own.

#### Model

![User-Group Model](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_usergroup.webp)

Thus you need to create one entity type to represent groups (or roles or profiles) and one for
accounts.

Each entity type needs to be shaped with properties, chosen according to the data useful for
entitlement assignment.

The only sensitive and required properties are those constituting the link between both entity
types, i.e. the navigation properties representing the group membership.

**Recommendation: categorize accounts in types**

Many of the managed systems following this model, just like the User model, distinguish between
several types of accounts.

In further steps, you will be able to define one resource type per account type and map each one to
a role for assignment and provisioning.

#### Example - SAB

The SAB system handles authorizations using users and groups. A user is authorized to perform an
action according to their group membership.

We define two entity types `SAB - User` and `SAB - Group`. We fill them with a few attributes useful
to manage entitlements in the SAB application. Finally, we add a navigation property in both entity
types in order to link `User` with `Group` with an "n-to-n" relationship.

![User-Group Example - SAB](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_sab.webp)

#### Example - RACF

The [RACF](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=zos-what-is-racf) connector is used to
manage critical entitlements on the mainframe. RACF is a complex system, but IGA purposes only
require information about accounts and groups, as entitlements are given by group membership. Thus
the system can be simplified to be managed by Identity Manager following the User-Group model.

![User-Group Example - RACF](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_racf.webp)

For RACF, Identity Manager provisions only the link between accounts and groups.

#### Example - TSS

The TSS connector is similar to RACF in its use, but manages fine-grained entitlements at a higher
level than RACF. TSS is at least as complex as RACF, and its connector follows a similar
simplification as RACF's.

Identity Manager manages users (with their accounts) and groups called here profiles. Both users and
profiles are grouped into departments, themselves grouped into partitions. Entitlements are called
authorizations, and are linked to users through group (profile) membership.

![User-Group Example - TSS](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_tss.webp)

For TSS, Identity Manager provisions only the link between users and profiles.

Identity Manager receives a write access for users and profiles, only a read access for the rest of
the model. It is interesting to keep the whole model for query goals such as listing a given user's
entitlements.

**Recommendation: categorize accounts in types**

Many of the managed systems following this model, just like the User model, distinguish between
several types of accounts.

In further steps, you will be able to define one resource type per account type and map each one to
a role for assignment and provisioning.

**Roles:** During
the[Create Roles in the Role Catalog](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/index.md)step for this
connector you can build roles based on the group-membership system represented by users and
profiles. Thus you will create navigation rules to represent the link between users and profiles.

#### Example - SDGE

The SDGE connector is used not to manage people but positions, so the application screens depend on
the user's position. In other words, Identity Manager is going to manage users' entitlements in SDGE
through their positions.

The object `User` or `Account` from the template, which contains users' accounts, is called here
`Worker`.

The object `Group` from the template is called here `Position` (grouped into organizations,
themselves grouped into organization types). It contains the way an entitlement is given, here
through a given position and wallet.

![User-Group Example - SDGE](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_sdge.webp)

For SDGE, Identity Manager provisions only workers and the link between workers and positions.

### Account-Profile-Transaction

#### Authorization mechanisms

The Account-Profile-Transaction model is better suited to represent a system, with the following
basic characteristics:

- To be able to perform an action or read a piece of data, a user must be granted one or several
  transactions. Transactions represent fine-grained entitlements. They can be associated to a type
  and conditions that restrict their use, such as a maximum per day or a context of validity.
- Transactions are not assigned directly to an account, but are packaged into profiles, which are
  then assigned to accounts, which are owned by users.
- Profiles can sometimes be classified into categories representing the sensitivity of the
  transactions they contain.
    > For example, profile categories can be `Privilege Profiles` for high privilege transactions on
    > sensitive data, and `Technical Profiles` for technical transactions related to system
    > administration.

#### Model

![Account-Profile-Transaction Model](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_profiletransaction.webp)

Thus you need to create one entity type to represent accounts, one for profiles, and one for
transactions.

Each entity type needs to be shaped with properties, chosen according to the data useful for
entitlement assignment.

The only sensitive and required properties are those constituting the link between entity types,
i.e. the navigation properties representing the packaging of transactions into profiles on the one
hand, and the assignment of profiles to accounts on the other hand. You can potentially add a
navigation property in the `Profile` entity type in order to categorize profiles within larger
profiles.

Instead of creating as many `Profile` objects as there are categories of profile, NETWRIX recommends
shaping the `Profile` object with a `category` attribute. Indeed, a multiple-object model
complexifies the addition of new profiles in the future. And as new profiles can be created in the
future though, then you must plan for it.

For example, instead of modeling two artificial types of profiles called `PP` for "Privilege
Profile" and `TP` for "Technical Profile", prefer a single object `P` that represents all profiles
using a specific attribute to differenciate technical from privilege profiles. This way, the model
sticks to the real capacity of the technical tool and all use-cases are considered.

See the schema below this note.

![Profiles Example](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_profiles.webp)

Transactions are not mandatory in a model. Most of the time, the profile packages are predefined
once and for all, or are the responsibility of the application owner. Then Identity Manager doesn't
need to manage the specific transactions for a profile directly inside the managed system. You can
hence avoid modeling transactions altogether. In this case, you fall back on the User-Group model
with a twist: if profile categories are relevant in the system's authorization mechanism, then you
must take them into account.

#### Example - TSS

The TSS connector is actually a mix of the User-Group and Account-Profile-Transaction models. The
User-Group part is explained above.

![User-Group Example - TSS](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_tss-prof-trans.webp)

Transactions are called here authorizations.

For TSS, Identity Manager provisions only the link between users and profiles. Transactions (and the
rest of the model) are only readable.

### Star

#### Authorization mechanisms

The Star model is better suited to represent a system, where the ability to perform an action is
granted through the assignment of entitlements, based on several variable parameters, most often the
combination of a profile and at least one user data criteria.

> For example, you might want to give certain entitlements only to users who have an administrator
> profile and work in Marseilles.

As the parameter combination is not predetermined, the whole system can become highly complex with
the addition of data criteria.

Users are represented by the accounts they own.

**Comparison with other models:** while the User-Group model grants an entitlement via a group
membership, the Star model grants said entitlement via a special authorization linking the right
criteria altogether (i.e. the right profile and other user parameters).

#### Model

![Star Model](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_star.webp)

Thus you need to create one entity type to represent accounts, one for each criterion, and another
one to represent the object linking acounts to criteria.

Each entity type needs to be shaped with properties, chosen according to the data useful for
entitlement assignment.

The difficulty of this model is to map everything to roles in the role model. In Identity Manager's
role model, one assignment is always one role. But in this case, in the managed system, an
assignment is a tuple of things.

To map the tuple of things on a role, we have several choices:

1. Create a role per possible combination of tuple of things. This can quickly get out of hand as
   far as the number of created roles is concerned.
2. Use parametrized roles. The number of roles will be contained, but it is a little more
   complicated to configure.

The flexibility generated by parameters is particularly interesting for roles that incorporate
entitlements in a more complex way than application roles. If the information contained in a role is
complicated to deduce, then parameters can bring some clarity in the configuration. The objective is
always to minimize the number of distinct roles, and the number of roles that are assigned to one
given identity.

#### Example

Consider an application which manages entitlement assignment with different rules, according to
users' profiles, attachment areas and sites. Our example shows 4 profiles, 4 attachment areas and 3
sites. So a user may be assigned a given entitlement for a given profile, attachment area and site.

![Star Model Example](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_starmodel.webp)

For this connector, Identity Manager provisions only the links between accounts and linking objects,
and the links between linking objects and each criterion.

Concerning roles, integrators have two options:

- either create a specific role for `Profile_i` with `AttachmentArea_j` and `Site_k` for all
  available profiles, attachment areas and sites, which makes a total of 48 roles (for a quite
  simple example);
- or create a single role with parameters for profiles, attachment areas and sites.

## Procedure Example

**Step 1: choose the connector model.**

Let's say we are modeling an Active Directory, which handles authorization through the group
memberships of accounts. In other words, to assign an entitlement to an identity, we make the AD
account of said identity member of the corresponding AD group. That is exactly what the User-Group
template is designed to handle. See the Model the Data topic for additional information.

![User-Group Model](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_usergroup.webp)

**Step 2: adapt the model to your reality.**

We start by renaming the `Account` object as `AD_User` and the `Group` object as `AD_Group`.

![AD Example - Step 1](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_ad-step1.webp)

**Step 3: define useful data close to your reality.**

We shape these objects with the following attributes:

![AD Example - Step 2](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/connectormodel_ad.webp)

**Step 4: ensure that all objects have unique keys.**

Indeed we defined `objectGuid` as a key for both accounts and groups.

**Step 5: ensure the guidelines' enforcement.**

We could content ourselves with this model. The main benefit of this model is to closely mimic the
reality of the AD authorization mechanism. But we'd like to go a bit further, applying a "keep it
open to changes" approach.

Observe the similarities between `AD_User` and `AD_Group`. There are many attributes repeating
between the two entity types.

We can simplify: prefer a single object `AD_Entry` that can represent both users and groups. The
difference between the two types of object will be made clear via specific properties like
`objectCategory`, `member` and `memberOf`.

Beyond avoiding repetition, this makes the model easily adaptable if new elements pop up.

> For example, we could want to include computers or organizational units in the model in the
> future. Instead of creating two new additional objects `AD_Computer` and `AD_OU`, the existing
> object `AD_Entry` can represent them both at no additional modeling cost. Even though we could add
> `AD_Computer` and `AD_OU` without merging groups with entries, designing `AD_Entry` with all these
> attributes provides the means to add objects without creating new entity types.
>
