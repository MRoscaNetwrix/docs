# Load Identities to Identity Manager

How to load identities into Identity Manager for the first time using a basic data model in the form
of a template MS Excel file.

## Overview

Loading the digital identities into Identity ManagerÂ is the very first task you have to perform,
once you installed the development environment.

The initial workforce repository is going to be the first version of a comprehensive directory
containing all users in the organization. This directory is crucial in setting up the identity
lifecycle management features and managing assignments of entitlements.

Identity Manager contains a template model, downloadable as an Excel file. Below is an example of a
part of the `UserRecord` tab, used in Identity Manager's demo:

### Useful data

Not all data is useful for identity governance and administration. Thus, to start designing the
repository, you must be aware of which data is necessary and which is unhelpful. Useful data is the
data that:

- needs to be provisioned to the managed applications;

    > For example, if you need to provision users' phone numbers in a given application, then you
    > should fill in the workforce repository's `Phone Number` property.

- is needed to manage identities' lifecycles;

    > For example, consider that internal employees must be managed by HR officers only, then you'll
    > need to identify whether users are internal employees or external contractors. Then you should
    > make sure that you fill an `Employee Type` property with at least two values: one for internal
    > employees, and one for external contractors.

- is needed to automatically grant permissions.

    > For example, if a user's position title ("manager" for instance), defines what users currently
    > do, and thus what permissions they need, then you should make sure to fill in a property
    > storing the position's title in the workforce repository.

## Participants and Artifacts

Integrators may need the help of the HR department who knows the organization in order to get the
identity and organizational data. After the initial loading, the HR department can review the data
to confirm its accuracy.

## Load Identities

Load identities for the first time by proceeding as follows:

1. On the home page, click on **Settings** in the **Configuration** section.

    ![Home Page - Configuration](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-configuration/home_settings_v523.webp)

2. On the **Workforce** > **Data Upload** page, download the empty Excel template.

    ![Upload Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/icondownload_v602.svg)

3. Collect identity and organizational data.

    If you don't know where to start, identities most often include long-term employees, temporary
    employees (such as interns and temps) and external contractors. The template contains a
    `UserType` tab that lists all the types of workers that you want to include, i.e. the usual
    identities listed just before, but also partners, clients, even applications.

    Workforce should include obviously all current workers, but also incoming workers, and those who
    left the organization in the past XXX (time period defined by the rules of the security
    officer). It is interesting to have past workers in order to understand the process and ensure
    that they are supposed to be orphaned. See the
    [Review Orphaned and Unused Accounts](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/administrate/orphan-unused-account-review/index.md)
    topic for additional information.

    **Employees**

    The workers that are directly employed by the organization usually have their data stored in the
    HR system.

    **Contractors**

    Often third-party workers like contractors are not part of the HR system. Then, there are a few
    possible solutions to get their data:

    - through purchasing department if it doesn't imply any personal data security breach;
    - manually with knowledgeable people, for example department managers and assistants;
    - through a filter on data from available directories, for example on the email address if it
      contains a specific string like `.ext@`;
    - through an Active Directory extraction with a filter on an attribute that works with a
      specific part, for example on the employee identifier.

4. Fill said template with the data you collected.

    The Excel file contains several tabs which organize data, but not all tabs and columns are
    mandatory. You can find **more details about the
    [Template Description](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/template-description/index.md)**. Below are the minimum recommended
    attributes (mandatory in orange):

    ![Template Recommendations](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/initialload_templatereco_v600.webp)

    [**Click here to download a template example**](/files/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/Directory_example_V602.xlsx).

    Every object (so every tab) of the directory must have a **key**, which is an attribute:

    - unique, i.e. designed to uniquely identify an object/resource, one key can't be shared;
    - immutable, i.e. must not change during the whole lifecycle of the object/resource, even for
      renaming for example;
    - consistent, i.e. identical everywhere the object/resource is specified.

    Among other things, a consistent key allows identities to use the same login in all
    applications. A consistent key is also essential to form the link between identities and the
    other objects (organizations, titles, etc.).

    **Create your initial workforce repository with only recommended attributes.**

    As we aim to quickly enable Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) actions (like the
    review of orphaned and unused accounts, or access certification, etc.), Netwrix Identity Manager
    (formerly Usercube) recommends loading identities with only necessary data. The model can be
    completed later.

    Moreover, Identity Manager's Query module can help gather data from other systems.

    For example, let's say that contractors' phone numbers are found only in the AD. Then we can
    wait for the connection of Identity Manager to the AD, and finally use the Query module to
    collect missing data. In this case:

    1. Upload the `Directory.xlsx` file with only recommended data, validate and synchronize as
       explained on this page.
    2. Connect the AD, synchronize AD data, update correlation and classification. See the
       [ Categorize Resources ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/categorization/index.md) topic for additional information.
    3. Follow the usual query procedure to request phone numbers from the AD.
    4. Ensure you display a key (for example `EmployeeId` or `email`) to master the order of the
       displayed data.
    5. Download the report.
    6. Copy the report's columns one by one to paste them into the Directory.xlsx file.
    7. Synchronize directory data.

5. Back on the **Workforce** > **Data Upload** page, upload the filled Excel file to the server in
   order to feed the data back to Identity Manager.

    ![Upload Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/iconupload_v602.svg)

    The latest uploaded file overwrites the previous one.

6. Click on **Verify and Synchronize** to check the file's consistency and import its data into
   Identity Manager.

    ![Verify and Synchronize](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/initialload_dataupload-synchronize_v602.webp)

    Now you are able to view users' pages in the directory.

    ![Directory - Users](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/initialload_directoryusers_v602.webp)

## Verify Identities Loading

In order to validate the process:

- Check manually a sample in the user directory accessible from the home page. You should verify at
  least your own sheet and the sheets for your hierarchy.

    ![Home - Directory User](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/configure-workflows/home_directoryuser_v523.webp)

- Check that every organization includes a manager. Organizations are accessible from the department
  directory on the home page.

    ![Home - Directory Department](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/home_directorydepartment_v523.webp)

    ![List of Departments](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/load-identities/initialload_departments_v602.webp)

    If the system contains many organizations, then it is also possible to list each organization
    with its manager through the Query module.

- Create reports with indicators on the number of workers per type or per organization for example
  (through Identity Manager's predefined reports, the Query module or Power BI), in order to ensure
  that Identity Manager's content sticks to reality.

    See the [ Generate Reports ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/administrate/reporting/index.md) topic for additional
    information.
