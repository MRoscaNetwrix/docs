# Create a Role Manually

How to create single roles manually.

## Overview

A single role is a way to represent an entitlement that is to be assigned to an identity. It brings
a layer of abstraction through a user-friendly name, close to the business view. See the
[Single Role](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md)
topic for additional information.

To be effective, roles must be linked to actual entitlements in the managed systems. Within Identity
Manager, an entitlement assigned to an identity is in fact represented by the value of a given
navigation property, in a resource owned by said identity. See the
[Create an Entity Type](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md)topic for additional
information. Thus, each role is linked to one navigation rule per entitlement. See the
[Resource Type](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md)
topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** For example, imagine that we want to grant unlimited Internet access to the administrator
profile of an identity. This entitlement won't be assigned directly to the identity but to its AD
administration account. In our Active Directory, there is a resource called
`<DL-INTERNET-Restricted>` identified from among AD entries as a group. So we need to add this group
membership to the properties of the identity's AD account, using `<DL-INTERNET-Restricted>` as a
value of the **memberOf** property.

## Participants and Artifacts

For a given managed system, integrators may need the help of the application owners who know the
application's users, entitlements and data model.

information.

## Create a Single Role

Create a single role by proceeding as follows:

![Home Page - Access Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/categorization/resource-type-creation/home_roles_v602.webp)

**Step 1 –** On the home page in the **Configuration** section, click on **Access Roles** to access
the roles page.

![createsinglerole](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-manual-creation/createsinglerole.webp)

**Step 2 –** On the roles page, click on the adequate category and create a role by clicking on **+
New** at the top right corner.

**Step 3 –** Fill in the fields.

- Identifier: Must be unique among roles and without any whitespace.
- Name: Will be displayed in the UI to identify the created single role.
- Policy: Policy in which the role exists.
- Entity Type: Entity type targeted by the role.
- Description: Description of the role.
- Tags: Label(s) that can later be used to filter the target roles of access certification
  campaigns. See the
  [Schedule a Certification Campaign](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/administrate/access-certification/certification-campaign-scheduling/index.md)
  topic for additional information.

    **NOTE:** Netwrix recommends using role tags when you want to perform an access certification on
    a set of roles that are from several categories.

- Category: Category which is to contain the created role.
- Secondary Categories: Other potential categories which are to contain the created role.
- Approval Workflow: Represents the number of validations required to assign the created role.
- Lock the end date: Locks or binds manual permission assignments to the identity's end date (as
  defined by the context rule).

    It has five options:

    - Inherited:The policy's setting will be used.
    - Explicit, by default not context bound: By default, the assignment's end date will not be
      context bound in order to encourage the manual entry of an end date.
    - Explicit, by default context bound: By default, the assignment's end date will be context
      bound and therefore locked, but a manual date can be entered.
    - Never: The assignment's end date will never be locked and needs to be specified manually.
    - Always: The assignment's end date is always locked according to the applicable context rule.

- Approve Role Implicitly: Needs at least the simple approval workflow. **Implicit** mode bypasses
  the approval step(s) if the person who makes the role request is also the role officer.
  **Explicit** refuses said bypass. **Inherited** follows the policy decision to approve roles
  implicitly or not. See the [Create a Policy](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/user-guide/optimize/policy-creation/index.md) topic for
  additional information.
- Prolongation without a new approval workflow
- Hide in Simplified View: Hides the role from the users' **Simplified View** in **View
  Permissions** dialog. This setting does not apply to roles which are either inferred or have
  workflow states which require manual action.
- Maximum Duration: Duration (in minutes) after which the role will be automatically revoked, if no
  earlier end date is specified.

    **NOTE:** The maximum duration impacts only the roles which are manually assigned after the
    maximum duration is set. Pre-assigned roles are not impacted.

    - If no duration is set on the role, the maximum duration of the associated policy is applied.
    - If the duration is set to 0 on the role, it prevents the associated policy from applying its
      maximum duration to it.

- Grace Period: Duration (in minutes) for which a lost automatic single role is prolonged. A review
  will be required to validate or decline the entitlement prolongation. Inferred entitlements won't
  be lost unless the end of the grace period is reached or the prolongation is declined.

    **NOTE:** The grace period is only applied if the loss of the entitlement is due to a change in
    the rules, i.e. rule deletion or criteria changes.

    If the grace period is not defined, the value is inherited from the policy.

**Step 4 –** Click on **Create** and see a line added on the roles page.

**Step 5 –** Create at least one navigation rule with the single role as a criterion.

Once you have completed the steps the single role is created.

## Create a Navigation Rule

Navigation rules aim to assign given resources to identities based on specific criteria. A
navigation rule sets the value of the navigation property on a specific resource, if a given
condition is met. It is linked to a parent resource type that sets the target entity type. One rule
creates one navigation.

Create a navigation rule by proceeding as follows:

![Home Page - Access Rules](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/home_rules_v602.webp)

**Step 1 –** On the home page in the **Configuration** section, click on **Access Rules** to access
the rules page.

![Entity Type Choice](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/provrules_entitytype_v602.webp)

**Step 2 –** In the drop down menu at the top left, choose the entity type to which the future
navigation rule will be applied.

![Addition Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-assignment/iconadd_v602.webp)

**Step 3 –** Click on the **Navigations** tab and on the addition button at the top right corner.

![Create a Navigation Rule](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-manual-creation/singlerolescatalog_createnavrule_v602.webp)

**Step 4 –** Fill in the fields.

- Join: Target property whose value is impacted by the created rule.
- Resource: Value to be set on the JOIN.
- Navigation denied: Option that forbids the resource assignment.
- Offset of effective date: Time period that defines the actual effective date according to the
  value's start and/or end date. An offset of effective date can be useful for some attributes. For
  example, account activation and deactivation can be managed according to the start and/or end
  dates.
- Criteria: Conditions that, if met, trigger the created navigation.

**Step 5 –** Click on **Create** and see a line added on the rules page.

Once you have completed the steps the navigation rule is created.

## Impact of Modifications

When deleting a single role, caution must be used when deleting the corresponding navigation rules.
Indeed, these rules thus lose their criteria and may be applied to far too many people after that.

## Verify Single Role Creation

In order to verify the process, check that the role and rule are created with the right parameters.

![Home Page - Access Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/categorization/resource-type-creation/home_roles_v602.webp)

**Step 1 –** For roles, click on **Access Roles** on the home page in the **Configuration** section.

![Access Single Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/namingrulecreation_testroles_v602.webp)

**Step 2 –** Select single roles and find the role you created inside the right category and with
the right parameters.

Our example would look like:

![Example - Generated Role](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/namingrulecreation_exampleroleresult_v602.webp)

![Home Page - Access Rules](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/home_rules_v602.webp)

**Step 3 –** For rules, click on **Access Rules** on the home page in the **Configuration** section.

![Access Navigation Rules](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/namingrulecreation_testrules_v602.webp)

**Step 4 –** Select navigation rules and find the rule(s) you created with the right parameters.

Our example would look like:

![Example - Generated Rule](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/namingrulecreation_exampleruleresult_v523.webp)

The verification of role creation has been completed.
