# Install the Development Environment

How to connect to Identity Manager's SaaS environment to set up the development environment.

When using Identity Manager's on-premise option, follow the procedure of installation of the
bootstrap version. See the [ Quick Start Guide](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/installation-guide/quick-start/index.md)
topic or additional information.

## Overview

The installation of Identity Manager's production environment usually takes time, while we want to
start configuring at once.

This is why Identity Manager offers a bootstrap version of the application, useful as a development
environment.

## Participants and Artifacts

Integrators must be in contact with Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube) to be able to get
infos about the SaaS tenant URL and authentication.
