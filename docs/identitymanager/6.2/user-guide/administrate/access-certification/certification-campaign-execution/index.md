# Execute a Certification Campaign

How to execute access certification campaigns, i.e. review specific entitlement assignments and
deprovision inappropriate access.

## Overview

The aim of an access certification campaign is to review specific entitlement assignments for
specific identities, in order to certify them and express an audit opinion that justifies their
necessity.

Once certification campaigns are scheduled, the assigned reviewers must decide for all relevant
assignments if they ought to be deleted or not.

## Participants and Artifacts

The execution part should be performed in cooperation with the staff who review access in the
campaign scheduling.  
 The monitoring part should be performed in cooperation with the staff in charge of campaign
scheduling.

## Execute Certification

Execute certification by proceeding as follows:

1. Access the ongoing campaigns by clicking on the **Access Certification** section on the home
   page.

    ![Home - Access Certification](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/administrate/access-certification/certification-campaign-execution/home_accesscertification_v523.webp)

    On this page, all assignments to be reviewed are listed.

    Each assignment can be commented by clicking on the corresponding icon.

2. Choose one of the three possibilities to verify all assignments one by one:

    In order to help reviewers in the decision-making process, each assignment shows a
    recommendation icon, indicating whether said assignment complies with the role model.

    See the icons below this note.

    The Recommended icon indicates that the entitlement has been automatically granted according to
    the security policy. You can approve it because it is compliant.  
    The Not Recommended icon indicates that the entitlement does not comply with the security
    policy. It is recommended to refuse it, unless the user really needs it.

    An absence of any icon indicates that the entitlement does not comply with the security policy.
    However, it has been manually granted or denied. Thus there is no recommendation, please review
    this entitlement carefully.

    ![Discouragement Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/administrate/access-certification/certification-campaign-execution/certifcampaign_icondiscouragement_v522.svg)

    - Either click on the approval icon to confirm that this entitlement is necessary for this
      identity.

    ![Approval Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/administrate/access-certification/certification-campaign-execution/certifcampaign_iconapproval_v522.svg)

    - Or click on the decline icon to confirm that this entitlement is not necessary for this
      identity.

    ![Decline Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/saas/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/certifcampaign_icondecline_v522.svg)

    - Or click on the three dots icon to highlight that this entitlement is not part of your scope
      of responsibility and forward it to the adequate person.

3. Click on **Confirm Decisions** on the left of the page.

    If you've made an erroneous decision, exiting the page before confirming offers the possibility
    to quit without saving and start over from the last confirm.

## Monitor a Certification Campaign

Existing certification campaigns are listed on the page accessible via the **Access Certification
Campaigns** button on the home page in the **Administration** section.

### Get reports

A **Download** button is available for each campaign. It downloads a CSV report that lists all the
entitlement assignments to be reviewed, the corresponding reviewers and their decisions.

### Send notifications

The notification icon on the line of a given campaign offers the possibility to send reminder
notifications to the staff who has not finished processing the campaign.

### Generate provisioning orders

Once entitlement assignments have been reviewed, the final step is to apply these decisions.

An **Apply Decisions** button is available for each campaign. It shows all the decisions made in the
campaign. The campaign administrator can then decide to actually apply said decisions and generate
the appropriate provisioning orders for deprovisioning unjustified entitlements. Said orders will be
considered during the next provisioning job.
