# Reporting

The Reporting module is used to generate basic reports in CSV using
[API query grammar](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration/api/query-language.md), or advanced reports using the
[ Business Intelligence ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/development/configuration-toolkit/xml-configuration.md) module.

See the [ Generate Reports ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/reference/index.md) topic for
additional information on generating reports.
