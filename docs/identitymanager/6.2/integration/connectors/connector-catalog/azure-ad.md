# Azure

This connector exports
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure)
resources, role definitions and assignments.

This page is about [ Azure ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration/connectors/connector-packages.md).

![Package: Cloud/Azure](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/azure/packages_azure_v603.webp)

## Prerequisites

Implementing this connector requires at least the `Security Reader` role, because Identity
ManagerÂ does not access the [Azure API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/) on behalf
of a user but with [its own identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/).

## Export

For a given Azure tenant with resources, this connector exports Azure resources, role definitions
and role assignments to CSV files.

### Configuration

This process is configured through a
[ Connection ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/development/configuration-toolkit/xml-configuration.md) in the UI and/or
the XML configuration, and in the `appsettings.agent.json > Connections` section:

                    ```

                        appsettings.agent.json

{ ... "Connections": { ... "<ConnectionIdentifier>": { ... } } }

````


The identifier of the connection and thus the name of the subsection must:

- be unique.

- not begin with a digit.

- not contain ```<```, ```>```, ```:```, ```"```, ```/```, ```\```, ```|```, ```?```, ```*``` and ```_```.

> The following example
>
>                         ```
>
>                             appsettings.agent.json
> {
>   ...
>   "Connections": {
>     ...
>     "AzureExport": {
>         "ApplicationId": "contosoAzure897",
>         "ApplicationKey": "25d408a1925d4c081925b\\d40819",
>         "SubscriptionId": "Contoso",
>         "TenantId": "25d40819-f23f-4837-9d50-a9a52da50b8c",
>         "AzurePath": "https://management.azure.com/.default",
>         "AzurePathApi": "https://management.azure.com",
>         "ResponseUri": "https://agent.usercubecontoso.com"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

# Microsoft Entra ID

This connector exports and fulfills user and groups from/to a
[Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id)
(formerly Microsoft Azure AD) instance.

See the[ Microsoft Entra ID ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration/connectors/connector-packages.md)topic for
additional information.

![Package: Directory/Microsoft Entra ID](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/microsoftentraid/packages_azuread_v603.webp)

## Overview

Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service which helps
your employees sign in and access resources in:

- External resources, such as Microsoft Office 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS
  applications;
- Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network and intranet, along with any cloud apps
  developed by your own organization.

## Prerequisites

Implementing this connector requires giving Identity Manager
[application permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts#application-permissions),
because Identity Manager does not access the
[Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) on behalf
of a user but with [its own identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service), and
delegated permissions are not enough. These application permissions require the consent of an
administrator of the target Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

See the[Register for Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/integration/connectors/connector-basics/configuration.md) topic on how to
register Identity Manager as an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform in order to grant
Identity Manager a service account which authenticates with the target Microsoft Entra ID.

## Export

For a configured set of directory objects on an Microsoft Entra ID instance, this connector exports
the list of configured attributes in the associated entity type mapping to a CSV file.

### Configuration

This process is configured through a connection in the UI and/or the XML configuration. See
the[ Connection ](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/development/configuration-toolkit/xml-configuration.md)topic for
additional information.

Or in the `appsettings.agent.json > Connections` section:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
appsettings.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "<ConnectionIdentifier>": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**NOTE:** The identifier of the connection and thus the name of the subsection must:

- be unique
- not begin with a digit
- not contain `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`, `*` and `_`

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
appsettings.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "AzureADExport": {
        "ApplicationId": "<contosoAzure897>",
        "ApplicationKey": "<25d408a1925d4c081925b\\d40819>",
        "TenantId": "<25d40819-f23f-4837-9d50-a9a52da50b8c>",
        "MicrosoftGraphPathApi": "<https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/>",
        "ResponseUri": "<https://agent.usercubecontoso.com>"
    }
  }
}
```

### Output details

This connector is meant to generate the following files:

- `<connectionIdentifier>_directoryobjects.csv` containing the property values from the entity type
  mapping associated with the connection.

  **NOTE:** The values are exported from the entities listed in the attribute `C0` of the
  `EntityTypeMapping`.

  For example, with the following configuration:

  Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
  script in the command line.

  ```

  <EntityTypeMapping Identifier="AzureAD_DirectoryObject" Connector="AzureAD" ConnectionTable="AzureADExport_directoryobjects" C0="user group directoryRole servicePrincipal">
    <Property Identifier="accountEnabled" ConnectionColumn="accountEnabled" />
    <Property Identifier="objectid" ConnectionColumn="id" IsPrimaryKey="true" />
    <Property Identifier="mail" ConnectionColumn="mail" />
  </EntityTypeMapping>

  ```

  Four entities are exported (`user`; `group`; `directoryRole`; `servicePrincipal`) and whose
  names are to be found in the column `@odata.type`. Then `AzureADExport_directoryobjects.csv`
  looks like:

  ```
  AzureADExport_directoryobjects.csv
  Command,@odata.type,accountEnabled,id,mail
  ...
  ```

  _Remember,_ attributes described as "Supported only on the Get `<entity_name>` API" in the
  [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0)
  documentation cannot be retrieved through this connector. The export task will raise an error if
  these attributes are used in your EntityTypeMapping.

  This connector supports
  [Microsoft Entra ID Schema Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-directory-schema-extensions)
  but does not support
  [Microsoft Graph Schema Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/extensibility-schema-groups).

- `<connectionIdentifier>_<navigationProperty>_<entity>.csv` describing the navigation property from
  one entity to another.

  For example `AzureADExport_members_group.csv` would look like:

  ```
  AzureADExport_members_group.csv
  Command,groupId,id
  ...
  ```

  Where command can be `insert`, `update` or `delete`; groupId is the id of the group; id is the
  id of the group member (in this context).

  **NOTE:** Only the navigation properties `members` and `owners` are exported. These navigation
  properties are automatically detected according to the data exported.

- one file `<connectionIdentifier>_cookie_<entity>.bin` per entity, containing an URL with a
  `delta token` useful for incremental export.

  > For example `AzureADExport_cookie_user.bin`

  _Remember,_ most exports can be run in complete mode, where the CSV files will contain all
  entries, or in incremental mode, where CSV files will contain only the entries which have been
  modified since the last synchronization.

  A task can use the IgnoreCookieFile boolean property, and a command line (with an executable)
  can use the option --ignore-cookies.

The CSV files are stored in the Export Output folder, and the cookie file in the Export Cookies
folder. See the
[Application Settings](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/administration/agent-configuration/agent-settings.md)
topic for additional information.

For more details, see Microsoft's documentation on
[columns and attributes synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-sync-attributes-synchronized).

## Fulfill

This connector writes to the Microsoft Entra ID, to create, update and delete Microsoft Entra ID
objects, initiated manually through the UI or automatically by enforcing the policy. See
the[Evaluate Policy](/docs/identitymanager/6.2/access-governance/role-management/role-assignment.md)topic for additional
information.

### Configuration

Same as for export, fulfill is configured through connections.

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
appsettings.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "AzureADFulfillment": {
        "ApplicationId": "<contosoAzure897>",
        "ApplicationKey": "<84468d65324ghj\\de9864d3d7e89026>",
        "TenantId": "<25d40819-f23f-4837-9d50-a9a52da50b8c>",
        "MicrosoftGraphPathApi": "<https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/>",
        "ResponseUri": "<https://agent.usercube.com>"
    }
  }
}
```
