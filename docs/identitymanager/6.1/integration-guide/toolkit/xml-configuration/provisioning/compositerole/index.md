# CompositeRole

Defines basic information about a composite role. Composite roles identify affiliations or job
functions by which users can be grouped. A composite role is a business role comprehensible by
managers. It provides a layer of abstraction above existing entitlements, technical roles and single
roles.

Roles can be used to:

- Grant various types and levels of access.
- Restrict access to sensitive information assets by grouping entitlements in a form that is
  meaningful to the business.
- Grant the minimum privileges required by an individual to perform his/her job.

Roles can be requested manually, or they can be configured to be assigned automatically via a
[Composite Role Rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerolerule/index.md).
To further control access, roles can be related via required, inherited, or permitted relationships.

## Examples

The following example declares a new composite role.

```

    <CompositeRole Identifier="HR_Accounting" DisplayName_L1="HR:accounting" Category="HR" ApprovalWorkflowType="One" EntityType="Directory_User" Policy="Default"/>

```
