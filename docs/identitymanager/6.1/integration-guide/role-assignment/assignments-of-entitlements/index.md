# Entitlement Assignment

Assigning entitlements means giving users specific permissions, or access rights, etc.

## Overview

As Usercube relies on a [role-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
assignment policy, entitlement assignment is simply role assignment.
[See more details](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/role-model/index.md).

So once a user is assigned a role, Usercube must make the right changes in the managed system(s) to
actually enable the corresponding permission. The values to be changed in the managed systems are
specified in provisioning orders.

Hence, an entitlement assignment is both the result of the execution of a provisioning order, and
the enablement of an access right.

## Automatic vs. Manual

Within Usercube, assignments can be created automatically, or can result from manual requests.

Automatic assignments are created by Usercube when
[evaluating the policy](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/index.md),
i.e. when computing expected assignments based on existing users and the policy's roles and rules.
Automatic assignments can either:

- result directly from the application of assignment rules on identities;
- be inferred, cascading, from another assignment.

Manual assignments and derogations are, on the other hand, requested individually through the UI.

## Assignments' Approval Workflow

Some entitlements require the approval of one or several knowledgeable users before actually being
assigned. This is standard procedure in many security-concerned organizations.

This is configurable through the role's or resource type's
[approval workflow type](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md).

Each step of the approval workflow is associated with a workflow state, so that all assignments can
be tracked and it is clear what step they are at.

All workflow states are detailed in the database schema of assigned roles or resource types, etc.

The same approval workflow is used for requests to add or remove roles.

> For example, Ms. Jackson requests for Mr. Smith the single role `Server Room Access` which has a
> two-step approval workflow:
>
> - At the end of the workflow, the assigned role has the workflow state `Requested`.
> - Once the assignment is processed, the workflow state switches to `Pending Approval 1/2`.
> - Once a reviewer approves the assignment, the state switches to `Pending Approval 2/2` (and if
>   the reviewer declined the assignment, the state would switch to `Declined`).
> - Once a second reviewer approves the assignment, the stat switches to `Approved` and the
>   assignment is finally effective.

### Provisioning state

In addition to the workflow state that represents an assignment's progress in the approval workflow,
any assignment also has a provisioning state to represent its progress in its lifetime from creation
in the database to provisioning to the managed system and to its eventual deletion.

Contrary to the workflow state that concerns all assignments, the provisioning state is only about
the assignments that need provisioning.

For example, roles exist only in Usercube and not in the managed systems, so assigned roles do not
have a provisioning state, unlike assigned resource types, scalars and navigations, etc.

The following schema sums up the usual progress of an assignment's provisioning state:

![Provisioning State Schema](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/provisioning/prov_stateschema_v523.webp)

All provisioning states are detailed in the database schema of assigned resource types, etc.

> For example, once Mr. Smith's role has completed the approval steps, we expect the provisioning of
> a navigation property:
>
> - It is not yet ready for provisioning because we decided to add a provisioning review by a
>   knowledgeable user because it is a sensitive permission, so the assigned resource navigation has
>   the `Awaiting Approval` provisioning state.
> - Once a reviewer approves the assignment, the provisioning state switches to `Pending`.
> - Once provisioning orders are computed and transmitted to the agent, the state switches to
>   `Transmitted`.
> - Once the agent confirms that the related order is executed, the state switches to `Executed`.
> - Once synchronization validates the consistency of the provisioned value with the policy, the
>   state finally switches to `Verified`.

Assignments whose provisioning orders are blocked because they are `Awaiting Approval` are to be
reviewed on the **Provisioning Review** screen.

## Non-Conforming Assignments

Once a policy is configured with all its rules and roles, Usercube can combine it with user
information in order to determine the expected assignments, i.e. the list of all assignments that
comply with the policy.

On the other hand, via synchronization Usercube can read the existing assignments, i.e. the list of
all assignments that actually exist in the managed systems.

Technically speaking, Usercube creates entitlements in the managed systems, and "translates" them
into role model language. In other words, Usercube create assignments based on the entitlements
found in the systems.

A simple comparison between these two lists defines the non-conforming assignments, i.e. the list of
all assignments that do not comply with the policy.

![Non-Conforming Assignments](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/role-assignment/assignments-of-entitlements/governance_nonconforming.webp)

A non-conforming assignment must be reviewed in Usercube by a knowledgeable user, and is therefore:

- either removed if Usercube correctly spotted it and the owner should indeed not possess this
  permission;
- or kept as an exception if the configured rules do not apply to this particular case.

Non-conforming assignments are to be reviewed on the **Role Reconciliation** and/or **Resource
Reconciliation** screens.

[See more details on reconciliation](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/role-assignment/evaluate-policy/index.md).

Non-conforming assignments can still be split into two categories:

- pre-existing when they are found during the very first synchronization because they existed before
  Usercube's implementation;
- simply non-conforming when they are found later.

> For example, consider a (navigation) rule stating that the `QuickBooks Level 1 Access` role
> entitles its owner to the `Active Directory QuickBooks` group membership, that enables them to
> access the organization accounting balance information through QuickBooks.
>
> Now, let's say synchronization finds the `Active Directory QuickBooks` group membership for Mr.
> Smith's Active Directory account. The trouble is, Mr. Smith digital identity has not bee assigned
> the `QuickBooks Access` role: this is an inconsistency.
>
> In order to fix the inconsistency, Usercube creates the assignment of this role to Mr. Smith to be
> reviewed by a knowledgeable user who can determine whether the assignment is legitimate or results
> from a mistake.

### Review automation

Usercube provides
[automation rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/non-conforming-assignment-review-automation/index.md)
to automate the review of non-conforming assignments by automatically approving/declining
assignments that were pending approval for some time, if this behavior is desired.

> For example, the single role `Server Room Access` is requested for Mr. Smith, with a two-step
> approval workflow. Ms. Jackson is supposed to review it, and then Mr. Jones. If Ms. Jackson takes
> too long, an automation can approve it, or most likely decline it, automatically. This way, the
> approval process ends and will need to be restarted at a later date if the need is genuine.

## Resource Type Assignments

Resource types are not as intuitive as roles because they are more complex and subtle. Assigning a
resource type materializes:

- the creation of a resource, usually an account, in the managed system;
- the creation of scalar and navigation properties for this new resource;
- the
  [categorization](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/index.md)
  of the created resource, which means both the correlation of the resource to an owner, and the
  classification of the resource into a specific type with specific rules between owner and owned
  resources.

### Reconciliation

Just like any other assignment, a resource type assignment can be non-confirming when the resource's
existence or its values do not comply with the policy.

> For example, a SAP account is found for a user who should not have one according to the role
> model's rules.

An account can also be an orphan when it is found in the managed system, but no owner could be
correlated.

### Consolidated states

A resource type assignment also has consolidated workflow and provisioning states to represent the
progress of the resource's scalar and navigation assignments.

Same as previously, the consolidated provisioning state represents the provisioning progress of the
resource type assignment together with its nested scalar/navigation assignments.

The consolidated workflow state represents the provisioning progress of the resource type assignment
together with its nested scalar/navigation assignments, and it is described by the following values:

- `ConsolidatedWorkflowReviewState` represents the progress in the approval workflow for a manual
  assignment;

    Except for very technical use cases, resource types should not be requested manually, they
    should only be inferred by a role and thus assigned automatically.

- `ConsolidatedWorkflowBlockedState` indicates whether one or more of the nested scalars/navigations
  are blocked;
- `ConsolidatedWorkflowFoundState` indicates whether one or more of the nested scalars/navigations
  are stated as non-conforming or pre-existing.

All consolidated workflow and provisioning states are detailed in the database schema of assigned
resource types.
