# Onboarding and Offboarding

In Usercube, onboarding and offboarding are done through workflows or through synchronization to the
HR system.

## Onboarding

The onboarding process for a new employee or contractor is materialized by the creation of a new
resource in the identity repository. This creation triggers the fulfillment of the entitlements
required by the user to perform their duties and be productive on day one.

The entitlement fulfillment can be performed in different ways:

- Usercube suggests the entitlements needed by the new user, prepares the provisioning procedures,
  and wait for the manual trigger of a manager or security officer.
- Usercube automatically triggers the provisioning of the entitlements needed by the new user,
  without any more human input.

[See more information about entitlement assignment](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/role-assignment/index.md).

The automation of the entitlement assignment processes can be really helpful. However, you should
not be looking for a full automation, but rather the smart automation of basic assignments such as
"birthrights", while the sensitive ones keep a manual process.

[See more information about assignment automation](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/index.md).

## Offboarding

The offboarding process doesn't necessarily mean the deletion of the resource from the identity
repository because, for legal and/or security purposes, the company may need to be able to access a
person's history in the company for a certain time, even after their departure.

This is why the departure triggers the removal of all entitlements for the departing identity.
Hence, Usercube knows all the past and present entitlements of any identity.

## Period of Validity

The joining and leaving of an identity are materialized by the identity's period of validity. This
way, the resource is valid from the start date until the end date.

These start and end dates can be configured to be different from the actual start and end dates of
the user's contract in the company.

These dates should then be part of entity types' properties (for example as `StartDate` and
`EndDate`), in order to be used in
[record sections](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/recordsection/index.md)
and
[context rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/contextrule/index.md).

At the start date, the resource is created and a few entitlements are assigned to the identity.

Between the start and end dates, the identity is part of all of Usercube's calculations
([role model](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/role-model/index.md), etc.).

At the end date, all the entitlements previously assigned to the identity are removed.

After the end date and until its explicit deletion, the resource is still in the identity
repository, but it is not part of any calculation anymore.

Keeping track of former employees usually helps solve issues involving orphan accounts.

A resource is deleted either via a resource-deletion workflow, or via the synchronization of HR
files if the user was removed from HR lists.
