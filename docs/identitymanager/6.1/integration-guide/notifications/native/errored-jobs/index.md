# Jobs with Errors

Usercube is able to send notification emails when a job ends with an error. The notification email
is sent to the user who has the necessary rights and the permission.

See the
[ Native Notifications ](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/notifications/native/index.md)
and
[ Profiles & Permissions ](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/profiles-permissions/index.md)
topics for additional information.
