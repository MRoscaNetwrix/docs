# Write a Template for a Ticket Connector

This guide shows how to write a template that will be used by a Ticket connector to complete the
title and the description of the ticket. The information which will be written in the ticket will
come from the generated provisioning order and from literal strings written in the template.

## Operations

The template uses the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) syntax. Several
operations are already provided, but you can find more on this
[page](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html).

Usercube also provides a way of using conditions with Mustache for the following operations:

- `>`: superior to
- `<`: inferior to
- `==`: equal to
- `!=`: different from

### Example

```

{{#each ProvisioningOrder.Changes}}
    {{#ifCond this '==' 'INTERNAL'}}
        This account is for an internal employee.
    {{else}}
        This account is for an external employee.
    {{/ifCond}}
{{/each}}

```

This template goes through all the changes provided by the provisioning order. If any one of them
meets the condition for an internal employee, we display the internal employee message. Several
messages can be shown if several changes meet the condition.

## Template example

```

Please create a resource "{{ResourceType}}" for user {{Username}}.

For more information on the user, see: {{UsercubeProfileLink}}

{{#ifCond ProvisioningOrder.ChangeType '==' 'Deleted'}}
  To delete the account, please contact the IT team.
{{/ifCond}}

{{#each ProvisioningOrder.Changes}}
  This is a change: {{this}}
{{/each}}

The resource must have the following values:
{{#Entity.GetEnumerator}}
	- {{Key}}: {{Value}}
{{/Entity.GetEnumerator}}

{{#DisplayAdd}}
Add the following links:
{{/DisplayAdd}}
{{#AddedLinkedEntities}}
	- {{Name}}
{{#Values.GetEnumerator}}
		- {{Value}}: {{Key}}
{{/Values.GetEnumerator}}
{{/AddedLinkedEntities}}

```
