## HR Application Description

The HR application is a demo application that represents a web based external system. The HR
application contains an employee list.

Each employee also has their own page, with the possibility to edit their profile or delete them. It
is also possible to add a new employee.

The HR application uses csv files as data sources. When a user is added, deleted, or edited, the csv
file will be modified, and the changes will be saved.

## Running the HR Application

The HR Application is part of the Usercube SDK, and comes with prefilled sources. To run the HR
application:

- Download the Usercube SDK.
- Go to `SDK/DemoApps/HR`.
- Modify **appsettings.json** > **CSVPath** to `"..\\Sources"`.
- Run `./HR.exe` in a command prompt.
- In a web browser, enter the URL `localhost:5000`.

The HR application is running, and the web browser is on the HR application employee list.

To set the HR application to another port, run `./HR.exe --urls http://localhost:{port number}`. To
access the application, enter the URL `localhost:{port number}` in a web browser.

Some ports are not recognized by web browsers, or may already be used. Choose a port wisely.
