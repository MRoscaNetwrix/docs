# Usercube-Invoke-Job

This tool launches a job on the agent side.

## Behavior Details

The
[Usercube-Invoke-Job.exe](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/index.md)
tool is a state machine.

![Schematization](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/executables/references/invoke-job/job_operation.webp)

When a job is launched, the state machine starts by computing all the tasks that must be launched in
the job.

Each task is assigned a launch order which can be
[configured in job steps](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/job/index.md).
All the job's tasks are grouped together according to their launch order, and they are launched by
group. Such task grouping allows the job to be faster executed.

The launch orders of all the tasks of a job can be listed by using the
[`Usercube-Get-JobSteps`](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/executables/references/get-jobsteps/index.md)
executable.

Before any task is launched, the state machine checks the task's parent tasks in order to verify
whether the task must be launched or not.

If the task must be launched, then the state machine checks whether the task should be started
server- or agent-side.

Then the task is launched, and then:

- if the task completes successfully, then the next task is loaded and started, or if this was the
  last task then the job ends successfully;
- if the task exits in error, then the whole job exits in error and stops;
- if the job is requested to stop from the UI, then the job's state switches to `cancelled` and is
  transmitted to the current task in order to not launch the next task;

    A canceled job is not stopped straight away, as the current task first needs to be finished.

- if the task exits in error while the warning mode is active, then the next job is loaded.

    Only export tasks can have this warning mode.

- if the task exits blocked, then the whole job stops and can be restarted manually at its
  breakpoint;

    Only synchronization and provisioning tasks can exit blocked.

In the case where the job is blocked and restarted:

- if the blocked task is a
  [`SynchronizeTask`](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/synchronizetask/index.md),
  then the state machine runs a synchronization validation on the related connector, and uses the id
  of the blocked task instance to synchronize the related tables;
- if the blocked task is a
  [`GenerateProvisioningOrdersTask`](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/generateprovisioningorderstask/index.md),
  then the state machine forces the same provisioning on the related connector.

    Both the synchronization validation and the forced provisioning are virtual jobs that do not
    exist in the database. However, they will be visible in the UI which keeps track of any launched
    task.

In both cases, the state machine resumes the job with the tasks that were not started due to the
blockage.

Any task launched by the state machine is linked to a job instance in order to keep track of the
launch group.
