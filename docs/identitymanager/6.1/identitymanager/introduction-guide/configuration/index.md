# Configuration

There are several options for configuring Usercube.

## Application Configuration

### User Interface

NETWRIX strongly recommends that Usercube be configured, as much as possible, via the UI.

### XML files

For advanced users, if the UI is not enough, Usercube can also be configured via XML files. These
XML files should be placed in a `Conf` folder directly inside the working directory.

### Database

Usercube's application configuration, whether it is made from the UI or the XML files, is stored in
a database which should never be modified manually.

## Network Configuration

Usercube's server and agent(s) are configured via JSON files, mainly `appsettings.json` and
`appsettings.agent.json`.

## Next Steps

This is the end of the introduction guide, so you should now be able to dive into:

- the [User Guide](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/identitymanager/user-guide/index.md) to configure Usercube
  from scratch via the UI, following the step-by-step procedures;
- the [Integration Guide](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/identitymanager/integration-guide/index.md) to
  complete Usercube's configuration in XML according to your needs;
- the [Installation Guide](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/identitymanager/installation-guide/index.md) to
  install Usercube in a production environment.
