# Install the Development Environment

How to connect to Usercube's SaaS environment to set up the development environment.

When using Usercube's on-premise option, follow the procedure of
[installation of the bootstrap version](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/installation-guide/quick-start/index.md).

## Overview

The installation of Usercube's production environment usually takes time, while we want to start
configuring at once.

This is why Usercube offers a bootstrap version of the application, useful as a development
environment.

## Participants and Artifacts

Integrators must be in contact with NETWRIX to be able to get infos about the SaaS tenant URL and
authentication.
