# Create a Role Manually

How to create single roles manually.

## Overview

A
[single role](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md)
is a way to represent an entitlement that is to be assigned to an identity. It brings a layer of
abstraction through a user-friendly name, close to the business view.

To be effective, roles must be linked to actual entitlements in the managed systems. Within
Usercube, an entitlement assigned to an identity is in fact represented by the value of a given
[navigation property](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md),
in a resource owned by said identity. Thus, each role is linked to one
[navigation rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md)
per entitlement.

> For example, imagine that we want to grant unlimited Internet access to the administrator profile
> of an identity. This entitlement won't be assigned directly to the identity but to its AD
> administration account. In our Active Directory, there is a resource called
> `DL-INTERNET-Restricted` identified from among AD entries as a group. So we need to add this group
> membership to the properties of the identity's AD account, using `DL-INTERNET-Restricted` as a
> value of the `memberOf` property.

## Participants and Artifacts

For a given managed system, integrators may need the help of the application owners who know the
application's users, entitlements and data model.

## Create a Single Role

Create a single role by proceeding as follows:

1. On the home page in the **Configuration** section, click on **Access Roles** to access the roles
   page.

    ![Home Page - Access Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/resource-type-creation/home_roles_v602.webp)

2. On the roles page, click on the adequate category and create a role by clicking on **+ New** at
   the top right corner.
3. Fill in the fields.

    ![Create a Single Role](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-manual-creation/singlerolescatalog_createsinglerole_v602.webp)

    - `Identifier`: must be unique among roles and without any whitespace.
    - `Name`: will be displayed in the UI to identify the created single role.
    - `Tags`: label(s) that can later be used to filter the target roles of
      [access certification campaigns](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/access-certification/certification-campaign-scheduling/index.md).

        NETWRIX recommends using role tags when you want to perform an access certification on a set
        of roles that are from several categories.

    - `Category`: category which is to contain the created role.
    - `Secondary Categories`: other potential categories which are to contain the created role.
    - `Approval Workflow`: represents the number of validations required to assign the created role.
    - `Approve Role Implicitly`: needs at least simple approval workflow. `Implicit` mode bypasses
      the approval step(s) if the person who makes the role request is also the
      [role officer](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/role-officer-management/index.md).
      `Explicit` refuses said bypass. `Inherited` follows the
      [policy](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/policy-creation/index.md)
      decision to approve roles implicitly or not.
    - `Allow Manual Assignment`: allows the role to be requested manually.

        Set to `No`, the role can be assigned only via automatic rules. Therefore, the associated
        [single role rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/automate-role-assignment/index.md)
        cannot have their `Type` set to `Suggested`.

    - `Hide in Simplified View`: hides the role from the users' **Simplified View** in **View
      Permissions** dialog. This setting does not apply to roles which are either inferred or have
      workflow states which require manual action.
    - `Maximum Duration`: duration (in minutes) after which the role will be automatically revoked,
      if no earlier end date is specified.

        The maximum duration impacts only the roles which are manually assigned after the maximum
        duration is set. Pre-assigned roles are not impacted.

        - If no duration is set on the role, the maximum duration of the associated policy is
          applied.
        - If the duration is set to 0 on the role, it prevents the associated policy from applying
          its maximum duration to it.

    - `Grace Period`: duration (in minutes) for which a lost automatic single role is prolonged. A
      review will be required to validate or decline the entitlement prolongation. Inferred
      entitlements won't be lost unless the end of the grace period is reached or the prolongation
      is declined.

        The grace period is only applied if the loss of the entitlement is due to a change in the
        rules, i.e. rule deletion or criteria changes.

        If the grace period is not defined, the value is inherited from the policy.

4. Click on **Create** and see a line added on the roles page.
5. Create at least one navigation rule with the single role as a criterion.

## Create a Navigation Rule

Navigation rules aim to assign given resources to identities based on specific criteria. A
navigation rule sets the value of the navigation property on a specific resource, if a given
condition is met. It is linked to a parent resource type that sets the target entity type. One rule
creates one navigation.

Create a navigation rule by proceeding as follows:

1. On the home page in the **Configuration** section, click on **Access Rules** to access the rules
   page.

    ![Home Page - Access Rules](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/home_rules_v602.webp)

2. In the dropdown menu at the top left, choose the entity type to which the future navigation rule
   will be applied.

    ![Entity Type Choice](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/provrules_entitytype_v602.webp)

3. Click on the **Navigations** tab and on the addition button at the top right corner.

    ![Addition Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/iconadd_v602.svg)

4. Fill in the fields.

    ![Create a Navigation Rule](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-manual-creation/singlerolescatalog_createnavrule_v602.webp)

    - `Join`: target property whose value is impacted by the created rule.
    - `Resource`: value to be set on the JOIN.
    - `Navigation denied`: option that forbids the resource assignment.
    - `Offset of effective date`: time period that defines the actual effective date according to
      the value's start and/or end date. An offset of effective date can be useful for some
      attributes. For example, account activation and deactivation can be managed according to the
      start and/or end dates.
    - **Criteria**: conditions that, if met, trigger the created navigation.

5. Click on **Create** and see a line added on the rules page.

## Impact of Modifications

When deleting a single role, caution must be used when deleting the corresponding navigation rules.
Indeed, these rules thus lose their criteria and may be applied to far too many people after that.

## Verify Single Role Creation

In order to verify the process, check that the role and rule are created with the right parameters.

For roles, click on **Access Roles** on the home page in the **Configuration** section.

![Home Page - Access Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/resource-type-creation/home_roles_v602.webp)

Select single roles and find the role you created inside the right category and with the right
parameters.
