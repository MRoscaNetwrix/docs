# Configure a User Profile

How to tweak the
[permissions](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/profiles-permissions/permissions/index.md)
for actions within Usercube, for a set of basic
[profiles](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/assignedprofile/index.md).

## Overview

All the permissions for accessing items and performing actions in Usercube are managed by assigning
[profiles](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/assignedprofile/index.md)
to users and
[permissions](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/profiles-permissions/permissions/index.md)
to profiles.

> For example, access to user lists with personal data is usually restricted to HR staff, and the
> modification of personal data would be restricted to HR managers.

We define here a permission as an entitlement within Usercube.

Permissions can be about:

- administration, which gives access to
  [administration](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/index.md) actions,
  accessible in the **Administration** section on the home page;
- directory, which gives access to users' data (with several available levels of access), and also
  any other data accessible in the **Directory** section on the home page;
- workflows, which gives access to actions for users' lifecycle (onboarding-movement-offboarding),
  through the workflows provided by Usercube within the **Directory** pages;
- reports, which gives access to Usercube's
  [predefined reports](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/reporting/index.md)
  about workforce.
- notifications, which enables notification reception when specific workflows are launched.

NETWRIX recommends creating and using the following profiles:

- `Administrator` for requesting entitlements, performing potential additional role reviews, and
  updating user data, the role model and the settings;
- `Helpdesk` for requesting entitlements and updating user data only, not for updating the role
  model or other settings;
- `HR` for managing internal users, i.e. creating, updating and deleting them;
- `Manager` for requesting their teams' entitlements and managing their external users, like
  contractors;
- `RoleOfficer` for reviewing and approving roles;
- `User` for basic viewing of user and organizational information.

A user can have up to 10 assigned profiles.

The goal here is to create profiles and link specific permissions to the profiles, in order to build
a set of typical profiles that will later be
[assigned to power users](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-assignment/index.md).
Instead of assigning permissions one by one to users, you will assign them sets of permissions (i.e.
profiles).

### Responsibility scopes

Each permission can be assigned a responsibility scope, which represents the scope of action of
users with said permission.

> For example, managers can be assigned the `View Requests` and `Manage Accounts` permissions, but
> only for the teams in which they have the manager title. In this case they will handle the
> entitlement requests within the team they manage, having their scope of responsibility defined as
> their team. It means that the manager cannot see or do anything outside the identities included in
> their team.

## Participants and Artifacts

Integrators must have the knowledge of the organization strategy towards the IGA project.

## Configure a User Profile

Configure a user profile by proceeding as follows:

1. On the home page, click on **Settings** in the **Configuration** section, then on **General** >
   **Profiles** in the left menu.

    ![Home - Configuration](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-configuration/home_settings_v523.webp)

2. Check whether the profile to configure is part of the provided list. If not, create it by
   clicking on the addition button at the top right and fill in the fields.

    ![New Profile](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-configuration/profiles_creation_v602.webp)

    - `Identifier`: must be unique among profiles and without any whitespace.
    - `Name`: will be displayed in the UI to identify the profile.

    Click on **Create**.

3. Access the page for profile configuration by clicking on **Workforce** > **Profiles &
   Permissions** in the left menu.
4. Follow Usercube's instructions for assigning permissions to the profile by clicking on the
   appropriate permissions, one by one, selecting if needed their responsibility scope.

5. Click on **Save** at the top of the page.

## Verify Profile Configuration

Before you can see the profile in action, it needs to be assigned to a user.

[See these instructions for assigning profiles to users](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/user-profile-assignment/index.md).

## Next Steps

Once user profiles are configured, integrators can start
[configuring onboarding workflows](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/index.md).
