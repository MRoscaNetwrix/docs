# Compute a Scalar Property

How to define
[scalar rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md)
to compute and provision the values of scalar properties for target resources based on source
resources.

## Overview

Sources are usually identities, and targets are usually accounts from the managed systems.

Here, we are going to compute the values of
[scalar properties](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md)
for the target resources used in entitlement management, based on source resources. We are going to
[provision](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/provisioning/index.md)
these properties, i.e. write them to the managed system.

The right tools for the job are scalar rules.

A scalar property's value can be computed by a scalar rule, based on at least one scalar property
from the source entity type, possibly writing a C# expression.

The application of a scalar rule can depend on the assignment of a
[single role](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/index.md).

Sometimes we create in Usercube properties which are not directly linked to any real property in the
managed system. A scalar rule on this kind of property will not find a property to provision in the
managed system, and thus will not produce any result.

For example, we may need to create in the AD the property `isUnused` (to spot unused accounts) with
a C# expression based on other properties from the same entity type. These properties, such as
`accountExpires` and `lastLogonTimestamp`, are each linked to a property from the AD, while
`isUnused` is for Usercube's use only. This scalar property `isUnused` does not exist in the AD,
thus **will never be provisioned to the AD**, and thus **will not be computed by a scalar rule**.

Also some properties, like `lastLogonTimestamp` in the AD or identifiers from ServiceNow, must be
changed only by their application. Usercube can/must not change these properties, thus **no
provisioning rule is appropriate for them**.

A scalar rule using a single role as criterion will trigger the creation of a target resource for
all impacted source resources (so all users), which are not yet correlated with a resource of this
resource type.

Without a criterion, a scalar rule does not create resources, and only computes the scalar
properties of existing resources.

## Guidelines

### Expression code must not contain too much data

Once configured, a rule is a complicated object to modify. Therefore, you must keep business data in
the resource and out of the expression. It is easier to change data than to change a rule.

> For example, consider an organization that manages email addresses according to the site with
> `.fr` for France and `.be` for Belgium.
>
> A working option could be to write an expression with a condition `if` on the site to assign the
> domain name. However, if the organization expands and needs to consider an additional country,
> then the rule requires change in the expression code.
>
> A better solution is to change the identity data model by adding a field `Domain Name` to describe
> the object `Site`, and to be used in the rule expression. In this case, if there is an additional
> country, then a new field is added in the data model for `Site` and `Domain Name`. Thus, the rule
> expression remains simple by using the new objects, for example
> `Email = FirstName + "." + LastName + "@" + Company + "." + DomainName`.

### Priority between scalar rules

A scalar rule with a role as a criterion has a higher priority than a rule without a role criterion.

> For example, consider the situation where we want the login `A` for users with the single role
> `RA`, and the login `B` for the others. In this case, we can write two distinct scalar rules where
> the first one has the role `RA` as a criterion. This rule will be applied before the other.

Other than that, there should not be more than one rule meant to provision a given property on a
given time period.

It means that:

- several rules computing the same property with different criteria should not coexist;
- the only reason to have several rules to compute a single property is when changing the property
  value over time, via
  [time offsets](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md).

## Participants and Artifacts

For a given managed system, integrators may need the help of the application owner who knows the
application users, entitlements and data model.

## Create a Scalar Rule

Fill an entity type with a scalar rule by proceeding as follows:

1. Click on **Access Rules** on the home page in the **Configuration** section.

    ![Home - Access Rules](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/home_rules_v602.webp)

2. In the dropdown menu at the top left, choose the source entity type for the future scalar rule.

    ![Entity Type Choice](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/role-naming-rule-creation/provrules_entitytype_v602.webp)

3. Click on the **Scalars** tab and on the addition button at the top right corner.

    ![Addition Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/iconadd_v602.svg)

4. Fill in the fields.

    ![Create Scalar Rule](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/scalar-property-computation/provrules_scalarrule_v522.webp)

    Once the `Resource Type` is provided, more fields appear.

    ![Scalar Rule Fields](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/scalar-property-computation/provrules_scalarrulefields_v602.webp)

    - **Source Object**: scalar property (or expression of scalar properties) from the source entity
      type, which constitutes the input for the computation of the target object. Can be defined by
      a property path and/or an
      [expression](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/expressions/index.md).
    - **Target Object**: scalar property from the target entity type, whose value is to be impacted.
    - `Offset of effective date`: time period that defines the actual effective date for property
      computation according to the value's start and/or end date.

        > For example, account activation and deactivation can be managed according to the start
        > and/or end dates.

    - `Applicable`: `Create & Update` to use this computation to both provision the managed system
      and synchronize the property back to Usercube; `Create Only` to use this computation to only
      provision the managed system and ignore this property during synchronization, this way the
      property can never be displayed as non-conforming.

        > `CreateOnly` is usually set to adapt the configuration to the constraints of the managed
        > system, when Usercube does not retrieve and/or update the property value.
        >
        > For example, consider a system, that we want to connect to Usercube (let's call it `SYST`)
        > using a `title` property. Consider also that `SYST` needs to be provisioned with the value
        > of `title`, but does not allow any other system to retrieve said value.
        >
        > In this case, we use `CreateOnly` so that Usercube sends the adequate provisioning order
        > when needed, and then is able to change the
        > [provisioning state](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/provisioning/index.md)
        > to `Verified` without
        > [synchronization](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/synchronization/index.md).

    - `Comparison type`:
      [comparison type](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md)
      between the value of the target object computed by the rule and its value from the managed
      system. Non-conforming values are displayed on the **Provisioning Review** screen.
    - **Criteria**: conditions that, if met, trigger the rule application.
        > Our example would look like:
        >
        > ![Scalar Rule Example](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/scalar-property-computation/provrules_examplescalar_v522.webp)

5. Click on **Create** and see a line added on the rules page.

## Impact of Modifications

Any modification in a scalar rule is taken into account when launching the role model computation
task, in the **Resource Types** frame of the corresponding connector's overview page, via **Jobs** >
**Compute Role Model**.

![Resource Type Jobs](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/synchro_resourcetype_v602.webp)

This task applies the rules and computes new properties. Therefore, if a given rule's criterion is
modified, then all corresponding assignments are computed again. If a resource was created
automatically for an identity through a scalar rule (and its single role criterion), and if the
user's criteria do not comply with the new version of the rule, then the corresponding resource is
automatically deleted.

A modification in a provisioning rule can trigger the removal of a resource only on the Usercube
side. There are several barriers to cross before said resource is removed from the managed system.

[Simulations](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/simulation/index.md) are
available in order to anticipate the changes induced by a creation/modification/deletion in scalar
rules.

## Verify Rule Creation

In order to verify the process:

1. On the corresponding connector's overview page, in the **Resource Types** frame click on
   **Jobs** > **Compute Role Model** to apply all rules.

    ![Resource Type Jobs](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/classification/synchro_resourcetype_v602.webp)

2. [Review unreconciled properties](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/non-conforming-assignment-review/property-reconciliation/index.md)
   (on the **Resource Reconciliation** screen) to help check scalar rules: if there are numerous
   properties to be reconciled following the same pattern, then there may be a rule that needs to be
   changed.
