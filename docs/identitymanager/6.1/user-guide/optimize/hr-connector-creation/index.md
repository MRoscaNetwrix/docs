# Create an HR Connector

How to create a
[connector](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/index.md)
dedicated to the automation of identity management (creation, update, deletion), via the
[synchronization](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/synchronization/index.md)
of HR data into Usercube and internal
[provisioning](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/administrate/provisioning/index.md).

## Overview

### HR connector in the global process

The HR connector is no priority but rather an optimization, handled at the end of the configuration
cycle.

The HR connector is sometimes the first created connector, used to develop the identity repository.

However, the HR connector requires a specific IT infrastructure (agent, proxy, Virtual Machine,
etc.) which can take time to implement, and delay the project's progress.

Moreover, in the long run it poses a few problems as HR data usually misses crucial information such
as contractor data, or the projects employees are working on. This can mean that:

- the identity repository is filled using several sources. And when creating identities
  automatically from HR data and other sources, you need to specify which properties of each
  identity can be overwritten by a change in HR and which cannot. This is to avoid manually changed
  attributes being overwritten by the HR data by mistake. This is very tedious.
- the HR data is rarely up to date early enough to be really useful as a trigger for identity
  creation and deletion. As a result, identities end up being created manually through workflows
  most of the time.

Hence we choose to build the first iteration of the project upon a manual data upload to
[create the initial identity repository](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/initial-identities-loading/index.md).

This way, we do not have to wait for the agent's implementation to create the first profiles and
start connecting systems (AD, SAB, SAP, etc.). Thus value is created faster and we can focus on IGA
activities such as the review of orphaned and unused accounts, eliminating risk earlier in the
process.

We can still connect HR data, later on, to check consistency between our identity repository and HR
data, through a certification-like process.

### Technical details

An HR connector is considered an inbound connector, as it writes to the central identity repository
inside Usercube.

As Usercube is able to feed all managed systems, it can also feed itself thanks to specific
connections such as the
[InternalWorkflow](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/internalworkflow/index.md)
connection. It means that the corresponding connector is able to launch workflows within Usercube
and keep track.

Typically, an HR connector with such a connection would be able to launch workflows inside Usercube
for identity creation, update and deletion, based on HR files.

## Participants and Artifacts

This operation should be performed in cooperation with HR staff who can access HR data.

## Create an HR Connector

Create an HR connector by proceeding as follows:

1. Outside Usercube,
   [model your connector](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-modeling/index.md).
2. [Declare an HR connector](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connector-declaration/index.md)
   using your local agent.

3. [Create an Export CSV connection](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/connection-creation/index.md)
   for each HR file to connect.

4. [Create the entity types](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md)
   corresponding to your model. For example:

    ![HR Entity Type - Navigation Properties](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/hr-connector-creation/hr_entitytypen_v602.webp)

5. Don't forget to
   [reload](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/index.md)
   and
   [synchronize](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/synchronization/index.md)
   to access HR data within Usercube.

## Verify HR Connector Creation

In order to verify the process:

1. Launch synchronization.
2. Access the connector's logs (from **Job Results** on the connector's dashboard) to ensure that
   synchronization completed successfully.

3. Check that the entity types have been added to the left menu of the home page.

    ![Test Entity Type](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/hr-connector-creation/hr_validatemenu_v600.webp)

4. Access the relevant entity types (from the menu items on the left of the home page) to check
   synchronized resources, by navigating in the UI from the accounts through a sample of
   associations, via the Eye icon:

    ![Eye Icon](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/synchronization/iconeye_v600.svg)

    You should seek configuration validation, not validation of the actual data being synchronized.
