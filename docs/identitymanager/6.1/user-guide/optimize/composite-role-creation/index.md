# Create a Composite Role

How to define
[composite roles](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerole/index.md)
in order to create sets of
[single roles](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/index.md)
easy to assign.

## Overview

A
[composite role](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerole/index.md)
is a set of single roles that are usually assigned together, because they revolve around the same
application, or the same job, etc. Composite roles are aggregates of single roles, they can help
organize the role catalog.

A composite role is a business role comprehensible by managers. It provides an additional layer of
abstraction above existing entitlements and single roles. We can say that if a single role allows a
user to perform a task, a composite role allows them to perform a job.

### Composite roles and Role Mining

Composite roles can also be created based on the rules provided by
[Role Mining](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/role-mining/index.md).
Rules link roles to dimensions.

The following example shows single roles from `A` to `F`. Role Mining suggested the rules on the
schema, linking these single roles to the organizations `R&D` and `Project` as well as to the
functions `developer`, `writer`, `contractor` and `project manager`. The idea is to use these rules
to create composite roles. Here, we clearly have one role for `R&D-developer`, one for `R&D-writer`,
`Project-contractor` and `Project-project manager`. Thus, it is clear here that composite roles add
an abstraction layer.

[Single role rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md)
link composite roles to
[single roles](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/index.md):
a single role rule states that specific single roles are assigned according to specific criteria,
particularly composite roles. Thus, a composite role assignment can imply specific single role
assignments.

## Participants and Artifacts

For a given managed system, integrators may need the help of the application owners who know the
application's users, entitlements and data model.

## Create a Composite Role

Create a composite role by proceeding as follows:

1. On the home page in the **Configuration** section, click on **Access Roles** to access the roles
   page.

    ![Home Page - Access Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/resource-type-creation/home_roles_v602.webp)

2. On the roles page, click on the adequate category and create a role by clicking on **+ New** at
   the top right corner.
3. Fill in the fields.

    ![Create a Composite Role](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/composite-role-creation/compositeroles_newcrole_v602.webp)

    - `Identifier`: must be unique among roles and without any whitespace.
    - `Name`: will be displayed in the UI to identify the single role.
    - `Policy`:
      [policy](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/policy-creation/index.md)
      in which the role exists.
    - `Entity Type`: entity type targetted by the role.
    - `Category`: category assigned to the role.
    - `Secondary Categories`: other potential categories assigned to the role.
    - `Approval Workflow`: represents the number of validations required to assign the role.
    - `Approve Role Implicitly`: needs at least a simple approval workflow. `Implicit` mode bypasses
      the approval step(s) if the person who issues the role request is also the
      [role officer](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/role-officer-management/index.md).
      `Explicit` refuses said bypass. `Inherited` follows the
      [policy](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/policy-creation/index.md)
      decision to approve roles implicitly or not.
    - `Hide in Simplified View`: hides the role from the users' **Simplified View** in **View
      Permissions** dialog. This setting does not apply to roles which are either inferred or have
      workflow states which require manual action.
    - `Comment Management on Permission Review`: to change if different from the role policy.
    - `Maximum Duration`: duration (in minutes) after which the role will be automatically revoked,
      if no earlier end date is specified. It impacts only the roles which are manually assigned
      after the maximum duration is set. Pre-assigned roles are not impacted. If no duration is set
      on the role, the `MaxDuration` of the associated policy is applied. If the `MaxDuration` is
      set to 0 on the role, it prevents the associated policy from applying its `MaxDuration` to it.

4. Click on **Create** and see a line added on the roles page.
5. Create at least one
   [single role rule](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/automate-role-assignment/index.md)
   with the composite role as a criterion.

## Impact of Modifications

When deleting a composite role, caution must be used when deleting the corresponding single role
rules. Indeed, these rules thus lose their criteria and may be applied to far too many people after
that.

[Simulations](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/simulation/index.md) are
available in order to anticipate the changes induced by a creation/modification/deletion in roles
and single role rules.

## Verify Composite Role Creation

In order to verify the process, check that the role and rule are created with the right parameters.

For roles, click on **Access Roles** on the home page in the **Configuration** section.

![Home Page - Access Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/set-up/categorization/resource-type-creation/home_roles_v602.webp)

Select composite roles and find the role you created inside the right category and with the right
parameters.

![Access Composite Roles](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/composite-role-creation/compositeroles_testroles_v602.webp)

For rules, follow the instructions about
[assignment rules](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/automate-role-assignment/index.md).
