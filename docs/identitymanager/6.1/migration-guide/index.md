# Migration Guide

This guide is designed to provide step-by-step procedures in order to migrate Usercube from your
current version to the latest one.

This page will guide you through a migration to a more recent version with no major changes.

For example from 6.0.215 to 6.0.216.  
For a migration between versions with major changes, check this guide's subsections.

For example see the
[ 5.2.X to 6.0 ](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/migration-guide/5.2.xto6.0/index.md) topic
for additional information on migration.

## Upgrade the Server Only for a Minor Migration

In order to upgrade only the sever do the following:

**Step 1 –** Download the new runtime from the expected version from
[Netwrix portal](https://extranet.usercube.com/).

**Step 2 –** Stop the server.

**Step 3 –** Rename the `Runtime` folder to create a backup, for example `RuntimeOld`.

**Step 4 –** Extract the content of the new runtime to the same folder as `RuntimeOld`, inside a new
`Runtime` folder.

**Step 5 –** Copy the original `appsettings.json` and `appsettings-agent.json` files from
`RuntimeOld` to the new `Runtime`.

**Step 6 –** Restart the server.
