# Integrations

Many customers use ticketing and change approval systems in the management of changes to all of their business systems not just Salesforce or NetSuite. Platform Governance for NetSuite provides integrations with external ticketing systems to improve workflows for customers using both. This brings all the benefits of Platform Governance for NetSuite to your external ticketing systems, including the impact analysis, release management and change reconciliation features.

Integrations with NetSuite include:

* [Jira](jira_integration) ticketing System Integration
* [ServiceNow](servicenow_integration "Open ServiceNow Integration topic") ticketing System Integration
* [Zendesk](zendesk_integration "Open Zendesk overview topic") ticketing System integration
* Our [Integration API](../api/api_overview "Open API Overview topic")Â enables your developers to support your ticketing systems, making the integration functionality available to everyone. Integrating your systems with your Platform Governance for NetSuite account helps you make the most of your change management and ticketing strategies.

The [Integration Mapping](integration_mapping "Open Integration Mapping topic") tool helps you map customizations between your External Systems and NetSuite.
