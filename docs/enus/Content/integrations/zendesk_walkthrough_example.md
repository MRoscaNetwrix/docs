### Use Bundles for the Scope of Change

Specify a Bundle to use a bundle for the scope of change. This is optional.

2. Enter the Bundle ID.
3. Click + to add the bundle. 232111 in this example. You can remove a bundle using the drop down toggle.

Once you have made a change, the **Request Approval** button is available if you are a member of a group with the [Set up Approvals](zendesk_integration#Setting "Open the set up approvals section") permission.

### Add Existing Customizations

Existing Customizations can be added to the change request with the **Look up Customization** feature.

2. Enter the search information in one or more of the available filters. For example, enter **new** for **Name** and select **Body Field** for **Type** to search for all body fields containing the word **new**.
3. Click **Lookup**.
