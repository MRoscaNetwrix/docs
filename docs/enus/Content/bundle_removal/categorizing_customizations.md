# Categorizing Customizations

Part of the bundle removal process is to categorize all the customizations in your account, this is completed with saved searches and csv imports and exports (due to some limitations with mass updates).

:::note
Bundle components that do not have relationships outside the bundle or customizations that are not related to the bundle need to be flagged with CSV imports/exports since mass updates do not have summary criteria for this type of search.

## Create First Saved Search

4. On the **Criteria** tab, click **Summary** and add the following:

| Summary Type | Field | Description | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sum | Formula (Numeric) | Is less than 1 | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_data\_source.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Sum | Formula (Numeric) | Is less than 1 | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_scripts.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Sum | Formula (Numeric) | Is less than 1 | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_cust\_forms.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Sum | Formula (Numeric) | Is less than 1 | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_wflws.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Sum | Formula (Numeric) | Is less than 1 | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_list.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Sum | Formula (Numeric) | Is less than 1 | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_searches.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |

5. On the **Results** tab, click **Columns** and fill in the following:

| Field | Summary Type | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internal ID | Group |  |
| Name | Group |  |
| Parent | Group |  |
| Formula (Numeric) | Sum | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_data\_source.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Formula (Numeric) | Sum | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_scripts.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Formula (Numeric) | Sum | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_cust\_forms.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Formula (Numeric) | Sum | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_wflws.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Formula (Numeric) | Sum | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_list.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
| Formula (Numeric) | Sum | CASE WHEN {custrecord\_flo\_searches.custrecord\_flo\_cleanup\_status} = 'To Be Cleaned Up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END |
