# Installation Overview

Installing Platform Governance for NetSuite is straight forward. Follow the steps in these topics to install the bundle, set access for the Strongpoint tab on the NetSuite toolbar, and manage users. There is a **Next Step** link at the end of each installation topic.

The bundle is installed using processor architecture for scheduled scripts. All deployments are set to low priority.

1. [Installing Strongpoint](installing_strongpoint)
2. [Running the Spider](running_the_spider)
3. [Setting Up AutoSpider and Alerts](setting_up_auto_spider_alerts)
4. [Managing Users](managing_users "Open the Managing Users topic.")
5. [Setting Access to the Strongpoint Tab](setting_strongpoint_tab_access "Open the Setting Access to the Strongpoint Tab topic")
6. [Setting Role Permissions](setting_permissions "Open Setting Up Role Permissions")

Once your installation is complete, you can review the [Installation Settings](installation_settings_report "Open the Configuration and Stats report topic") report.

Optional menu items are hidden by default to keep the menus clean and easy to use. If users do not see a menu item, they can turn it on through Menu Management, assuming the feature is included in your License Type.
