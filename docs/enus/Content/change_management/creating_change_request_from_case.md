# Creating a Change Request from a Case

If [Enable Case to Change Request Workflow](../installing_strongpoint/installation_settings_report#CasetoCR "Open the Installation Settings topic to see how to enable this feature") is enabled, you can automatically create a Change Request directly from your Case:

1. Open **Lists** > **Support** > **Cases**.
2. **View** a Case.
3. Click **Create Change Request**.

The Change Request is created, populating the fields specified in the [Case to Change Request Field Mapping](../installing_strongpoint/installation_settings_report#CasetoCR "Open the Installation Settings topic for more information on Field Mapping set up") set up. The Change Request status is set to **Not Started**.

:::note
If the Create Change Request button is not visible on the Case, the Enable Case to Change Request Workflow is not enabled. Contact your system administrator.
