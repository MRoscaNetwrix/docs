# UAR Owner

Owners are set up by the UAR administrator to perform permission and/or membership reviews to assure they are appropriate:

* **Role Permission Review**: Review Permissions and Permission Levels granted within the Role
* **Membership Review**: Review the individuals assigned to the Role

The [Owner User Access Reviews List](owner_uar_list "Open Owner User Access Reviews List topic") topic has details for accomplishing your reviews.

Owners are notified with an email message when a new review has been assigned. You can click one of the links in the email, or login to NetSuite and open [User Access Review](../access_app "Opening the UAR app") to access the dashboard.

1. Open **User Access Review** from NetSuite.
2. Click **UAR Owner** to log in. Your owner dashboard is displayed.
