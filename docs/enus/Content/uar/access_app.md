# Accessing User Access Review

The User Access Review bundle must be [installed](install_app "Jump to installation topic"), and users must have NetSuite accounts and a UAR license to access User Access Review.

**User Access Review** is available on the NetSuite menu bar if you have a [license](install_app#Licensin "Licensing the app"). If it is not on your menu, contact your Netwrix or NetSuite administrator.
