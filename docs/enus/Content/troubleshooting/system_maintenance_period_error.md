# System Maintenance Period Error

Usually a *System Maintenance Period* error indicates your primary web site in NetSuite is in maintenance mode, which blocks the display of all HTML content. If your web site is down for maintenance, you can resume using Platform Governance for NetSuite once your maintenance is complete and your web site is online again.

:::note
If the Take Web Site Offline for Maintenance option is changed, you must use the Strongpoint > Strongpoint Support > License Manager > Get Lic. Number Or re-push the bundle to update the Spider link.
:::

In most cases, if you are not using NetSuite web sites there is no impact on your system so you can do the following:

1. Open **Setup** > Select **Site Builder** > **Set Up Website**
2. Click **Edit** for the Primary site.
3. Uncheck **Take Website Offline for Maintenance**
