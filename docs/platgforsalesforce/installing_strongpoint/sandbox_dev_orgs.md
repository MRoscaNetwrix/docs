# Sandbox Accounts

Salesforce sandbox accounts are set up for testing. Data storage is now optimized in these accounts
to make the most of their limited capacity. Default documentation is not created. Refer to the
[Salesforce documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=data_sandbox_environments.htmandtype=5)
for specifications and feature comparisons of sandbox types.

When a sandbox is identified, Platform Governance for Salesforce limits excessive data storage by
not creating the following items:

- Customizations for reports not used in more than a year.
- Change logs are not automatically created for Developer or Developer Pro sandboxes, but change
  detection. last modified date, and environment compare can be used.
- Report and Workflow joins are not created for Developer or Developer Pro sandboxes. They are
  enabled for Partial and Full sandboxes, but can be disabled to save space.
- Separate XML representation files are not created.
- Separate JSON representation files are not created.

If you need to see the Customizations for an object, open the Scanner, select the object, and click
**Run Scanner**.

## Controlling Sandbox Change Log, Junction and Report Creation

You can enable/disable change log, junction, and report creation for a sandbox from the
**Configuration and Stats** page.

From the Netwrix Dashboard: click **Configuration and Stats** in the **Resources** section, or open
**Settings** > **Configuration and Stats**.

The initial setting is selected on the [Scanner](/docs/platgforsalesforce/installing_strongpoint/setting_up_initial_scan.md) page of the **Install
Wizard** when installing the sandbox.
