# Allowed Commands

It is important to ensure that only authorized commands can be used to avoid any unintended consequences. Change Tracker provides a stringent approval process for any new commands being introduced, either for a report or policy template, and all reports/templates are analyzed to ensure all commands used are approved.

If a new command is encountered, this will be flagged as such:

![](/img/changetracker/admin/AllowedCommands.png)

You can either immediately click the warning to access the approvals workflow and you can show a listing of all reports/policy templates with Untrusted commands using the filter on the **Policy Admin** page.

Clicking on the **Not Trusted** link, you will be invited to enter a code generated by the 2FA resource linked to the Change Tracker instance during initial setup.
