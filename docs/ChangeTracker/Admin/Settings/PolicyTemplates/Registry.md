# Policy Templates: Registry

**NOTE:** This template applicable to Windows OS only.

**NOTE:** To select a Registry Key to monitor, the best way is to use the Microsoft ‘regedit’ program (start -> run -> regedit). You can then browse all Registry Keys for the device and at any point use a ‘right click’ to access the tools menu which includes an option to ‘copy key name’. You can then paste the key name into the **Compliance Hub** field.
