# User Notifications

Once devices have been assigned to Device Groups and a Configuration Template has been assigned, a Baseline of the configuration will be recorded and thereafter, any changes detected can be reported as email or syslog alerts.

Each Netwrix Change Tracker user can be assigned a personalized alerting profile from a range of event options for each Device Group.
