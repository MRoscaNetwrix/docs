# Sample Scripts:

**NOTE:** For script debugging and advanced scripting requirements, you may find it easier to use the ‘**Script Console**’ packaged with any Proxy Agent installation. You can run the Script Console from *C:\Program Files\\NNT Change Tracker Suite\Gen7Agent (NetCore)\\NNT.Script.Console.exe* program name **NNT.Script.Console.exe**

The sample scripts provided in this section all include a Main Script and a Logon Script dialogue, however, for Production Agentless Tracker’s, the Logon script only is used within the Credentials key with the Main Script commands being configured with the relevant Configuration Template.
