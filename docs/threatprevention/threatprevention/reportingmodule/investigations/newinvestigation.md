To generate a new investigation report, configure the filters as desired and set the timeframe. See the [Filters Section](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/reportingmodule/investigations/options/filters.md) topic for additional information.

Then click __Run Query__. The report data is displayed in the sections below the Filters section. See the [Investigation Reports](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/reportingmodule/investigations/reports.md) topic for additional information.

__NOTE:__ If you run a query without applying filters, the report sections display all activity by all users for the designated timeframe, which is set by default to _Last Hour_.

The report generated by a New Investigation can be exported. The Schedule Export option is not available from the New Investigation page. See the [Export Report](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/reportingmodule/investigations/options/export.md) topic for additional information.

The Save option allows you to save your configured filters to run the investigation again later.
