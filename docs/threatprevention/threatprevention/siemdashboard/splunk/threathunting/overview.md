# Threat Hunting App for Splunk

The Netwrix Threat Hunting solution enables organizations to target and hunt active cyber threats.
Using the preconfigured Netwrix Threat Hunting App for Splunk, analysts have a powerful incident
response tool that allows them to quickly and efficiently compile forensic evidence to investigate
the scope, impact, and root cause of an incident. The Netwrix Threat Hunting App for Splunk focuses
in on the actions of specific users, including the files they accessed and changes they made to
escalate privileges to data resources.

You can integrate Netwrix products with the Netwrix Threat Hunting App for Splunk. Both Threat
Prevention and Netwrix File Activity Monitor can be configured to monitor Threat Hunting events and
send the monitored events to Splunk.

- If only Netwrix File Activity Monitor is configured to send events to Splunk, only the cards that
  show file system activity will display data.
- If only Threat Prevention is configured to send events to Splunk, all the cards will display data.

After installing the Threat Hunting App for Splunk, ensure that the applicable Netwrix product(s)
have been configured to send events to Splunk.

## App Installation in Splunk (Threat Hunting)

Download the [Stealthbits Threat Hunting App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3646/)
from the [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/). Then follow the
[Splunk Add-ons](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Installingadd-ons)
guide provided by Splunk to install the app.

The Netwrix Threat Hunting tab will appear in the Splunk web interface.

After installing the Netwrix Threat Hunting App for Splunk, configure it to receive data from either
Threat Prevention or Netwrix File Activity Monitor.

## Initial Configuration of the Threat Hunting App for Splunk

Follow the steps to configure Splunk to receive data from either Threat Prevention or Netwrix
Netwrix Activity Monitor.

_Remember,_ prior to using the Netwrix Threat Hunting App for Splunk, the relevant Netwrix product
must be configured to send data to Splunk.

**Step 1 –** Determine the IP address of the Splunk console. If Splunk is hosted on a UNIX machine,
run `ifconfig`. If Splunk is hosted on a Windows machine, run `ipconfig`. This IP address is
required for the following:

- To configure Threat Prevention to send data to Splunk. See the
  [SIEM Tab](../../../admin/configuration/systemalerting/siem.md) topic for additional information.
- To configure Netwrix File Activity Monitor to send data to Splunk. See the File Activity Monitor
  App for Splunk topic in the
  [Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor)
  for additional information.

**Step 2 –** Navigate to the Settings menu in the Splunk web interface and click Data Inputs.

**Step 3 –** Select UDP.

**Step 4 –** Click New and add a new data input with port 514. If another Splunk UDP input is
already using 514, you should be able to safely use another value (515 or higher), as long as it is
not blocked by the network.

**Step 5 –** Click Next.

**Step 6 –** Under Input Settings, enter the following information:

- Source Type – Enter one of the following options:

    - For data coming from Threat Prevention – Threat Prevention
    - For data coming from the Netwrix File Activity Monitor – **SFAM**

- App context – Select Search and Reporting
- Host – Select IP
- Index – Select Default

**Step 7 –** Review and save the new settings.

**Step 8 –** To test that the configuration is working correctly, check the Search and Reporting app
inside of the web console for Splunk (search for SFAM or Threat Prevention). There should be logs of
events that are generated as soon as Splunk starts receiving data. If there are no events, use a
packet sniffer to ensure that packets are being sent correctly between the two hosts, and diagnose
any possible network issues.

The Netwrix Threat Hunting App will now display activity from either the Activity Monitor data or
the Threat Prevention data.
