# SIEM Dashboards

Threat Prevention (formerly StealthINTERCEPT) can seamlessly integrate with all SIEM dashboards that a company is leveraging. For convenience, Netwrix has created a custom app for integration between Threat Prevention and three specific dashboards.

- IBM QRadar Integration
- Splunk Integration - Active Directory
- Splunk Integration - Threat Hunting

Additionally, you can also go to the [SIEM Output Viewer](/docs/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/siemoutputviewer.md) window to view the data Threat Prevention sends to syslog (SIEM).
