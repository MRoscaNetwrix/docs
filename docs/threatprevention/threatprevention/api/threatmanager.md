# Netwrix Threat Manager APIs

The following APIs are related to where Threat Prevention sends the event data to, and how to retrieve the current settings:

- Set-SIDefendConfig
- Get-SIDefendConfig

The following APIs are related to the LDAP Deception trap options on the Honey Token Tab of the [Netwrix Threat Manager Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/threatmanagerconfiguration.md):

- Get-SILdapDeception
- Set-SILdapDeception

## Set Threat Manager Configuration

The ```Set-SIDefendConfig``` command tells Threat Prevention where to send the event data from all tab settings on the [Netwrix Threat Manager Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/threatmanagerconfiguration.md). There are three methods available for data output:

- Threat Manager AMQP (URI/Port) – Sends event data directly to Threat Manager
- File on an Agent – Sends event data to a specified file. The server must have a deployed Agent.
- Activity Monitor – Sends event data either directly to an Activity Monitor port or a file, that Activity Monitor will access on a domain controller where both the Threat Prevention Agent and Activity Monitor agent are located. Then Activity Monitor must be configured to send the data to Threat Manager. See the [Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor) for additional information.

  _Remember,_ the port number for Activity Monitor is 4499.

The following parameters are required:

- AppToken – String generated on the App Tokens page of Threat Manager Configuration menu
- URI – Threat Manager hostname or IP address
- Protocol – Specifies the behavior of the string as AMQP or File path
- Path – File path to the Agent location where Threat Prevention event data is sent. This parameter is required when the protocol is set to File.
- ComputerName – Location the Threat Prevention Agents send event data for Threat Manager. This parameter is required when the protocol is set to AMQP.
- Port – Threat Manager port. The default is 10001.

Example using URI and AppToken to connect to Threat Manager:

```Set-SIDefendConfig -URI "amqp://192.168.9.52:10001" -AppToken "egJhbGciOiJIi8of71eg0Ulwk5o2nm5p..."```

Example using an output file on an Agent:

```Set-SIDefendConfig -Path "C:\TestOutput" -Protocol "File"```

Example using Activity Monitor to send to Threat Manager:

```Set-SIDefendConfig -Protocol "amqp" -ComputerName "LocalHost" -Port "4499"```

## Get Threat Manager Configuration

The ```Get-SIDefendConfig``` command is used to return all settings on the Event Sink Tab of the [Netwrix Threat Manager Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/threatmanagerconfiguration.md).

## Get LDAP Deception

The ```Get-SILdapDeception``` command provides the current information configured in the Honey Token Tab of the [Netwrix Threat Manager Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/threatmanagerconfiguration.md).

## Set LDAP Deception

The ```Set-SILdapDeception``` command changes the settings on the Honey Token Tab of the [Netwrix Threat Manager Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/threatmanagerconfiguration.md).

_Remember,_ these settings must be an exact match to the configuration set up in the Threat Manager Honey Token threat.

The following parameters are required:

- Enable [Bool]
  - 1 to enable
  - 0 to disable
- ReplacementSamAccountName
- SourceSamAccountName
- SubstitutionType
  - 1 for exact match
  - 2 for a substring

Example of LDAP Deception parameters:

Set-SILdapDeception -E "1" -S "SamAccountName" -R "NameToReplace" -T "1"
