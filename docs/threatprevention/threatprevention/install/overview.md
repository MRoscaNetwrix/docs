# Installation

Threat Prevention consists of a number of components that work together to monitor activity in Active Directory, Exchange, and file systems.

- Threat Prevention Enterprise Manager
- Threat Prevention Windows console (Administration Console)
- Threat Prevention Agent deployed to Active Directory domain controllers, Exchange servers, and file servers
- Threat Prevention EPE Rest Site that third parties can use to integrate with the Enterprise Password Enforcer (EPE) solution
- Netwrix Threat Manager Reporting Module that is installed with a separate installation package

__NOTE:__ Threat Prevention supports the deployment of remote Administration Console, enabling you to install additional consoles on standalone machines, like administrator or user workstations. In this way, users can launch the Administration Console on their workstations, as an alternate to using it on the Enterprise Manager server only.

The following components are installed by the Threat Prevention installation package:

- Threat Prevention Prerequisites – .NET 4.7.2 or .NET 4.8.x installed. If the installer does not find it already installed, it will install .NET Framework 4.7.2.
- Enterprise Manager

  - Creates the NVMonitorConfig and NVMonitorData databases on the designated SQL Server
  - Installs the Threat Prevention Enterprise Manager service
- Administration Console – Installs the user application for administering the Threat Prevention application

- [Administration Console Remote Install](adminconsole.md)
- [Agent Information](agent/overview.md)

## Antivirus Software Considerations

Occasionally, an organization’s antivirus program may shut down the processes launched by Threat Prevention. The processes that may be impacted are listed below.

Threat Prevention Server

Files located within the Threat Prevention installation directory: ```…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention```

- SIWinConsole.exe
- SIEnterpriseManager.exe
- SI.ReportingServicesHost.exe
- SI.Services.Schedule.Host.exe
- SIWindowsAgent.exe

Agent Server

Files located within the Threat Prevention Agent installation directory: ```…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIWindowsAgent```

- SIWindowsAgent.exe
- SIAgentUpdater.exe
- plsahlp.sys
- ActiveDirectoryMonitorLoader.dll
- SI.ActiveDirectoryMonitor.dll

The following file in the directory: ```…\Netwrix\\Netwrix Threat Prevention\Group Policy```

- SIGPOAgent.exe

The following file in the directory: ```…\Netwrix\StealthAudit\FSAC```

- SBTService.exe

Client Machines

If you are using Threat Prevention's Enterprise Password Enforcer (EPE) User Feedback module for client machines, the following file should be excluded:

- SI_CredentailProvider.dll

If this file is blocked by antivirus software, the reasons for rejecting a candidate password will not be displayed to the end-user, but all EPE rules will be fully enforced.

Domain Controllers

- PPE.dll – If PPE.dll does not load, the password policy will not get enforced

### Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer (PPE)

If you are using Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer, the processes that may be impacted are listed below.

Client Machines

The following DLLs on the client machines (all computers, mostly end user desktops/laptops) will not work if they get blocked by antivirus software:

- PPEClt.dll
- APRClt.dll

Netwrix Password Reset Server

If you are using Netwrix Password Reset, then make sure the antivirus program does not block the following files on the Netwrix Password Reset server:

- apr.sdf
- aprlog.sdf

These files get updated frequently, so there may be some performance benefit, and they do not contain any executable code.
