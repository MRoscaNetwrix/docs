# Import the License

Threat Prevention comes with a temporary 6-day license.

Follow the steps to import a license key file to continue using the product.

__Step 1 –__ Contact your Netwrix Sales Representative and request for a license key.

__NOTE:__ The .key file from sales must contain 'stealthintercept' in its name for Threat Prevention to recognize it and convert it to a .lic file.

__Step 2 –__ Save the license key file to the following folder:

…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager

![Import License](../../../../static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/install/importlicense.webp)

__Step 3 –__ The SIEnterpriseManager service automatically recognizes and imports the file.

__Step 4 –__ (Optional) Restarting Enterprise Manager is often required after importing a new license key as that would stop the application from alerting about the expired license.

The license key has been successfully imported. The organization’s license information is available on the [License Manager Window](../admin/navigation/licensemanager.md).
