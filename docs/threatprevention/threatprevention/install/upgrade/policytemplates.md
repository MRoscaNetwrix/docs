# Upgrade Policy Templates

When new or updated policy templates are available with a Threat Prevention upgrade, they are not automatically imported when you install the latest version. The Import feature can be used to update templates and import new templates.

Follow the steps to upgrade policy templates and import new templates.

__Step 3 –__ To import all new templates, select the __SI_Template_All__ XML file. Click __Open__.

__Step 4 –__ The Import window displays information for the template(s). Click __Import__.

__Step 5 –__ An Import Decision window opens when a duplicate collection or template is found. Choose between:

- Replace Existing

__Step 6 –__ Check the Apply to All box option to apply the selection to all duplicates found.

__NOTE:__ To only import new templates, check the __Apply to All__ box and select __Skip__.
