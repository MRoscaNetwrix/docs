# Agent Silent Install Option

You can use command line options to install the Agent silently. These options can be leveraged to deploy the Agent via custom batch files, login scripts, or for integrating with third-party software distribution solutions that an organization may already have in their environment.

MSI Compliant Command-Line Options

The WiX installer application for Agent runs under control of Windows installer component (MSI). Therefore, standard MSI command-line options can be used with the “threatprevention-agent-7.4.0.xxx.exe” install.

Available command-line options can be found in the [Microsoft Standard Installer Command-Line Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa372024(v=vs.85).aspx) article.

Two of the more useful options are:

- Silent installation option – ```/q```
- Logging option – ```/log "file_for_logging.log"```
