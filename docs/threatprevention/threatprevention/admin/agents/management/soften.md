# Soften Agent

You can soften a previously hardened Agent. Softening unlocks the Agent so it can be controlled from within the local Service Control Manager.

Follow the steps to soften the Agent on a server.

__Step 1 –__ Click Agents in the left pane to launch the Agents interface.

__Step 2 –__ Right-click a hardened Agent and select __Soften Agent__ on the menu.

__Step 3 –__ On the Access Verification window, the system performs a prerequisites or verification check that can fail or succeed.

- Failed – Read the failure messages and close the window. Ensure any error messages are taken care of prior to the next attempt.
- Success – Click __Next__ to begin softening the Agent.

__NOTE:__ The wizard does not block access to the Administration Console and can be minimized while actions are in progress. If this wizard is hidden by clicking outside of the dialog box, a flashing blue link displays on the upper right corner of the interface with the action name displayed. Click this link to bring back the focus to the wizard.

__NOTE:__ Closing the Administration Console while this action is in process causes problems with data collection.

__Step 4 –__ The Soften Agent window displays the task in progress and then its status as either:

- Failed – Read the failure messages and close the window. Ensure any error messages are taken care of prior to the next attempt.
- Completed – Indicates that the task is completed

__Step 5 –__ When the task is successfully completed, click __Finish__ to close the window.

The Agent has been softened.
