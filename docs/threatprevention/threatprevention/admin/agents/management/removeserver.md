# Remove Server from List

The Agents Interface displays a list of servers where the Agent has been deployed. You may want to remove a server from this list for any reason, such as when the Agent is no longer required on the server.

__NOTE:__ If the server has a deployed Agent, it will be added back to the list the next time the Agent sends information to the Enterprise Manager.

Follow the steps to remove a server from the list on the Agents Interface.

__Step 1 –__ Click Agents in the left pane to launch the Agents interface.

__Step 2 –__ Right-click a server and select __Remove Server from List__ on the menu.

The server is removed from the list.
