__Step 2 –__ Enable or disable the following options:

- Logs retention period, days – Log retention period for activity logs (TSV files) created by the Threat Prevention Agent for Windows servers or by the Activity Monitor Agent for NAS devices and then read by the Threat Prevention Agent. This does not affect File System Access Analyzer event types.   
  The Threat Prevention Agent reads logs in real time and retains the original logs for a set number of days before the logs are automatically deleted. This setting configures the log retention period for all enabled policies using the File System Changes and/or File System Lockdown event types. By default, it is set to 10 days.
- Microsoft Office temporary files filtering – Global setting that is checked by default. If checked, the temporary files associated with Microsoft office operations, such as copy, paste, etc., are not monitored. When unchecked, all the temporary files associated with Microsoft office operations are monitored.
- FS inherited permissions filtering – Reports separate events for the parent object and each child object. When checked, it reports an event only for the parent object.
- Exclude selected accounts – When checked, the user-supplied list of AD user and group names as well as well-known SIDs for built-in users/groups are excluded from file system monitoring and blocking policies at the global level. See the Select Local Processes to Exclude topic to specify accounts.
- Exclude selected processes – When checked, the user-supplied list of processes are excluded from the file system monitoring and blocking policies at the global level. See the Select Local Processes to Exclude topic to specify processes.
- Include Folder read / list operations – When checked, all list/read folder operations are included in the reporting for file system monitoring and blocking at the global level.
- Ignore SYSTEM account for NTDS.DIT file – When checked, access to the .dit file by the SYSTEM account will not be reported by a File System monitoring policy and not be blocked in the case of a File System blocking policy. Backup programs often use the SYSTEM account to access the .dit file and you may not want to report on or block such activity.
