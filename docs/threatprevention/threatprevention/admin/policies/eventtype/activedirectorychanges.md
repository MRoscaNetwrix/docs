# Active Directory Changes Event Type

The Active Directory Changes event type can be configured to generate an event when an Active Directory object or attribute is changed (add, delete, modify, move, rename).

The event filters for the Active Directory Changes event type are:

- AD Event
- Domains/Servers
- AD Context
- AD Classes
- AD Attributes
- AD Objects
- AD Perpetrator
- IP Addresses (from)
- Hosts (from)
- Success
- Advanced Filter

![Policy window - Active Directory Changes Event Type](/static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/policies/eventtype/adchanges.png)

Each filter tab acts like an "AND" statement for the filter. Any filter tab left blank is treated like an "ALL" for that filter set.

## AD Event Filter

Use the AD Event filter to select Active Directory events to be monitored or locked down by the policy.

![Policy window - AD Event filter](/static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/policies/eventtype/adevent.png)

Check the __All__ box to monitor or lockdown all operations, or select specific operations:

- Object Added – The policy monitors for objects being added to Active Directory
- Object Deleted – The policy monitors for objects being deleted from Active Directory
- Object Modified – The policy monitors for Active Directory objects being modified
- Object Moved or Renamed – The policy monitors for Active Directory objects being moved or renamed

If applied to a Lockdown Event Type, the policy both monitors and lockdowns the objects based on the selection.

## Domains/Servers Filter

Use the Domains/Servers filter to set the scope of the policy to specific domains and/or servers or to exclude specific domains and/or servers.

![Event Type - Domains/Servers Monitoring filter](/static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/policies/eventtype/domainsserversmonitoring.png)

Attribute, Operator and Value

When an attribute is selected, it is added to the filter and a drop-down menu is displayed in the Operation column with __Any Value__ selected. You can further scope the attributes to enable the policy to only capture events based on the new value. Use the Operation and Value columns of the Include Attributes and Exclude Attributes boxes to achieve this.

The Operation drop-down menu has the following options:

- Any Value – No scoping applied for this attribute
- (empty value) – Blank attribute values
- Equal – Attribute values that are identical to the Value field
- Not Equal – Attribute values that do not match the Value field
- Less Than – Attribute values below the numeric value or before the alphabetical value supplied in the Value field
- Greater Than – Attribute values above the numeric value or after the alphabetical value supplied in the Value field
- Contains – Attribute value includes the user supplied string (numbers are treated as strings) in the Value field
- Not Contain – Attribute values do not include the user supplied string (numbers are treated as strings) in the Value field
- Starts with – Attribute values start with the user supplied string in the Value field

Select an __Operation__ and type a value in the textbox. The value may include alphanumeric characters, string type, or dates. Only one value is supported; do not specify multiple values for the attribute. Also the Value field is not case sensitive.

When you select another attribute, a new row is added, where you can specify an operator and a value for that attribute. Each row is treated as an “OR” statement. If any event matches any of the attribute filters, then the event data includes all attributes in the list.

__NOTE:__ You cannot specify more than one value for an attribute and you cannot select the same attribute twice. To use the same attribute again, you have to add the same event type again to the policy, select that event type and then select a previously used attribute to include in the Add Attributes filter.

When the userAccountControl attribute is included or excluded in the filter, selecting the Any Value dropdown opens the [User Account Control Window](/docs/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/policies/eventtype/window/useraccountcontrol.md) with additional UAC flags to add to the filter.

## AD Objects Filter

Use the AD Objects filter to set the scope of the policy to only monitor specific objects in Active Directory or to exclude specific objects from being monitored.

- Both Success and Failure – Monitors all events that are within the scope of the respective filters for the event type

## Advanced Filter

Use the Advanced Filter to include or exclude attribute conditions for monitoring Active Directory changes.

![AD Changes event type - Advanced Filter](/static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/policies/eventtype/advancedadchanges.png)

You can define a criteria (filter statements) to monitor event data based on event data values or event attribute values or both.

Filter statements can be added to the Include condition and Exclude condition boxes. The filter uses pre-defined logical and comparison operators to create filter criteria for the scan. You can add conditions to a filter statement. Conditions can be singular or grouped by a logical operator.

In the screenshot above, the Exclude condition box displays singular conditions while the Include condition box displays conditions grouped by logical operators.

Logical Operator

The logical operator is displayed as left aligned red text. To change the logical operator, click on it to open a menu with the following options:

- And
- Or
- Not And
- Not Or

Add icon (+)

To add a filter (condition) to the filter statement or to start a new group of filters, click the __Add__ (+) icon. Then select:

- Add Condition – Adds a conditions to the filter statement
- Add Group – Adds a group with a conditions and a logical operator to the filter statement

A new row is inserted that displays an event data drop-down menu, a comparison operator, and a Value box.

Event Data Selection

The Event Data drop-down menu is displayed in orange. it contains a list of all the fields that can be part of an event. Click it to select an event name. Your selection is displayed in orange text in the box below.

The “Attributes: New” and “Attributes: Old” options are special cases discussed below in detail.

Comparison Operator

The comparison operator drop-down menu is displayed in blue. To change it, click on it to open a menu with options that associate with the selected event data field.

If you have selected the “Attributes: New” or “Attributes: Old” option in the Event Data drop-down menu, then only the following comparison operators are available:

- ContainsValue
- DoesNotContainValue
- EqualsValue
- StartsWithValue
- EndsWithValue

Your selected comparison operator is displayed in blue text in the box below.

Value

The value box is displayed in green. Click in it to type a value, then press Enter. The value is displayed in green text in the box below.

__NOTE:__ The Value box only accepts a single string except when the “Attributes: New” or “Attributes: Old” option is selected in the Event Data drop-down menu.

In case of “Attributes: New” and “Attributes: Old”, type three comma separated values (parameters) in the Value box in the following format:

%name%,%suboperation%,%value%  
(White space is not allowed between the comma and the argument, unless white space is part of the argument.)

where:

- %name% – The attribute name, for example 'member' (case insensitive)
- %suboperation% – Attribute sub-operation, which can be Add Attribute, Add Value, Remove Attribute, Remove Value, or Change Attribute (case insensitive)
- %value% – The attribute value (case insensitive)

All the parameters are optional and only evaluated if non-empty. This means that you can select attributes either only by %name% or %suboperation% or %value% or by combination of %name%/%suboperation%/%value%.

If %value% is not specified, all the functions behave in the same way because they implement the same logic for %name% / %suboperation% comparison. The difference is applicable only when %value% is specified.

Following is how the comparison operator (displayed in blue) works with %value%:

- ContainsValue – matches if an attribute has any value containing %value%
- DoesNotContainValue – matches if an attribute does not have any value containing %value%
- EqualsValue – matches if an attribute has any value equal to %value%
- StartsWithValue – matches if an attribute has any value starting with %value%
- EndsWithValue – matches if an attribute has any value ending with %value%

Examples of how the comparison operator (displayed in blue) works with Value

| Comparison Operator | Value (%name%,%suboperation%,%value%) | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ContainsValue | description,Change Attribute,testdescription | Matches any attribute where:   - name is 'description' - operation is 'Change Attribute' - value contains 'testdescription' |
| ContainsValue | ,Change Attribute,testdescription | Matches any attribute where:   - operation is 'Change Attribute' - value contains 'testdescription' |
| ContainsValue | description,,testdescription | Matches any attribute where:   - name is 'description' - value contains 'testdescription' |
| ContainsValue | ,,testdescription | Matches any attribute where:   - value contains 'testdescription' |
| ContainsValue | description  OR  description,  OR  description,, | Matches any attribute where:   - name is 'description' |
| ContainsValue | description,Change Attribute  OR  description,Change Attribute, | Matches any attribute where:   - name is 'description' - operation is 'Change Attribute' |

Example of a filter statement with "Attribute New"

Following is an example of a filter statement defined in the Include condition box with the "Attribute New" option.

![Example of an advanced filter](/static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/policies/eventtype/filterstatement.png)

```And  
[Attributes: New] [StartsWithValue] [telephoneNumber, change attribute, (555)]```

This filter statement would only generate an event if an object's telephoneNumber attribute is changed and the new value starts with (555), rather than generating an event every time the telephone number is changed.
