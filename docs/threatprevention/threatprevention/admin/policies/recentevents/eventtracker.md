__Step 1 –__ Events and incidents have a state of New when they are first generated. When a user reviews an event, they can use the State drop-down menu to change the state to __Reviewed__ or back to __New__.

__Step 2 –__ Type your remarks in the Comments box regarding the review of the event.

__Step 3 –__  On saving your changes, the Last Updated user and date timestamp are updated.

On the window from where you opened the Event Tracker Window, use the Tracking state or a similar drop-down menu to filter the events/incidents in the data grid according to the Event Tracker status. Options are:

- All – All events/incidents
- New – Events/incidents that have not been reviewed
- Reviewed – Events/Incidents that have been reviewed
