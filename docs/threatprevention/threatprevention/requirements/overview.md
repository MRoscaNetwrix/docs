# Requirements

This topic describes the recommended configuration of the servers needed to install the Threat Prevention application in a production environment. Depending on the size of the organization, you must review your environment and requirements with a Netwrix engineer prior to deployment to ensure all exceptions are covered.

## Architecture Overview

The following servers are required to install the application:

Core Component

- Threat Prevention Application Server – The following v7.5 application components are installed here:

  - Enterprise Manager
  - Administration Console
- Agents – The Agents are deployed in the target environment to monitor and/or block activity
- Netwrix Threat Manager Reporting Module Server – The Reporting Console is installed here. This can be on the same server as the Threat Prevention server, but that would require the server resources to be sufficient for both applications.
- SQL Server for the Threat Prevention Database – As a data-intensive application, a well-provisioned, dedicated SQL Server is recommended. The SQL Server should be on a separate server from the Threat Prevention server.

See the following topics for additional information:

- [Application Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/requirements/application.md)
- [SQL Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/requirements/sqlserver.md)
- [Agent Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/requirements/agent.md)
- [Reporting Module Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/requirements/reportingserver.md)

Optional Components

- Remote Administration Console Instances – The Administration Console can be deployed remotely on additional machines. As a prerequisite, the Threat Prevention server must already be provisioned.
- EPE Rest Site – This is an optional web server that third parties can use to integrate with the Threat Prevention Enterprise Password Enforcer (EPE) solution. It allows third-party applications to submit a candidate password to check whether it complies with the current EPE rules defined on the [EPE Settings Window](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/configuration/epesettings.md).

  __NOTE:__ This interface does not change the password; it only validates it against the EPE rules.

See the following topics for additional information:

- [Remote Administration Console Machine Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/requirements/adminconsole.md)
- [EPE Rest Site Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/requirements/eperestsite.md)

Target Environment Considerations

The target environment encompasses all servers, devices, or infrastructure to be monitored and/or protected by Threat Prevention:

- Active Directory – Deploy an Agent to all domain controllers
- Exchange – Deploy an Agent to all HUB, CAS, and Mailbox Exchange servers and one domain controller
- File System:

  - Windows – Deploy an Agent to all file servers containing objects that need to be protected
  - Network Attached Storage (NAS) Devices – This requires integration with Netwrix Activity Monitor. Deploy an Agent to the proxy server where the Netwrix Activity Monitor Activity Agent is deployed. See the [Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor) for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.
