# Firewall Ports

The following default ports are required for Threat Prevention functionality unless modified as per network requirements. If choosing the Create Windows Firewall Rules option either in step 6 of the [Application Server Install](../install/application.md), in step 6 of the [Administration Console Remote Install](../install/adminconsole.md), on the Set Options page of the [Deploy Agents Wizard](../admin/agents/deploy/overview.md#deploy-agents-wizard), or in step 7 of a [Manual Agent Deployment](../install/agent/manual.md), then Threat Prevention will create the necessary Windows firewall rules. If using a third party firewall, it will be necessary to manually set these.

__NOTE:__ SIEM ports are configured when SIEM alerting is enabled in Threat Prevention. See the [System Alerting Window](../admin/configuration/systemalerting/overview.md) topic for additional information.

The Windows firewall rules need to be configured on the Windows server, which require certain inbound rules be created if the scans are running in applet mode. These scans operate over a default port range, which cannot be specified via an inbound rule.
