# Threat Prevention 7.5

> Real-time protection layer for critical enterprise systems

Threat Prevention 7.5 strengthens organizational defenses by providing a real-time protective barrier around critical IT infrastructure including Active Directory, Exchange, and file systems. Unlike traditional security solutions that only detect threats after the fact, this solution intercepts and blocks malicious activities at the source, preventing damage before it occurs while maintaining comprehensive audit trails for compliance and forensic analysis.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Activity Monitoring**: Continuously track changes, authentications, and access attempts as they happen
- **Proactive Threat Blocking**: Automatically prevent unauthorized actions before they compromise systems
- **Policy-Based Enforcement**: Define and enforce custom security policies with automated responses
- **Enhanced SIEM Integration**: Stream enriched security events to SIEM platforms for centralized monitoring

## Benefits

- **Prevent Security Breaches**: Stop attacks in real-time rather than discovering them after damage
- **Protect Business Operations**: Ensure critical systems remain secure and operational
- **Accelerate Incident Response**: Immediate alerts and automated blocking reduce response times
- **Strengthen Compliance**: Detailed audit trails meet regulatory requirements

## What's New in Version 7.5

- New SIEM Output Viewer for real-time data stream monitoring
- Simplified ADMonitor updates without full agent reinstallation
- Enhanced reporting capabilities with improved data visualization
- Performance improvements for high-volume environments
