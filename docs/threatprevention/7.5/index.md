# Netwrix Threat Prevention v7.5 Documentation

Netwrix Threat Prevention strengthens an organization’s defense against internal and external
threats by acting as a real-time protective layer around critical systems, including Active
Directory, Exchange, and file systems. Unlike native Windows logging, it intercepts and blocks risky
activity at the source - before damage occurs - offering greater visibility, control, and response
capabilities.

- Active Monitoring — Threat Prevention continuously monitors changes, authentications, and access
  attempts without relying on native logs. It inspects all critical activities at the point of
  origin, alerting security teams to policy violations and potentially malicious behavior in real
  time.
- Proactive Blocking — Beyond detection, Threat Prevention can automatically block unauthorized or
  suspicious actions, such as group membership changes, GPO modifications, or logon attempts from
  compromised accounts. This stops threats like ransomware and privilege escalation before they
  impact business systems.
- Real-Time Alerts and Enforcement — It enforces custom security policies with immediate alerts and
  automated responses, enabling fast remediation and minimizing potential damage or downtime.
- Comprehensive Audit Trail — Threat Prevention records rich, contextual event details, including
  pre- and post-change values, helping auditors and admins understand what happened, when, and by
  whom, without the noise or delay of native logs.
- Seamless Third-Party Integration — It feeds enriched, real-time data to SIEM platforms and other
  tools, ensuring security teams receive actionable intelligence instantly, with no need to parse
  Windows event logs.
- Modern, Secure Architecture — Built for the evolving security landscape, Threat Prevention uses a
  FIPS 140-2 compliant architecture to meet modern security and compliance requirements.

Organizations can use Threat Prevention to:

- Detect and investigate suspicious authentication behavior
- Proactively prevent unauthorized changes to critical systems
- Automatically block the riskiest actions before damage occurs
- Speed up investigations and reduce response time
- Strengthen overall security posture and streamline compliance
