- Top GPOs – Displays up to the top five (5) Group Policy Objects related to events that have been
  recorded in the specified timeframe. See the
  [Graph Card Features](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/siemdashboard/qradar/navigate.md#graph-card-features) topic for additional information.
- Successful/Blocked Events – Breakdown of Group Policy Object changes that have been recorded in
  the specified timeframe by successful/failed/blocked status. See the
  [Graph Card Features](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/siemdashboard/qradar/navigate.md#graph-card-features) topic for additional information.
- Changes by Domain – Breakdown of Group Policy Object changes that have been recorded in the
  specified timeframe by domain. See the [Graph Card Features](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/siemdashboard/qradar/navigate.md#graph-card-features)
  topic for additional information.
- Change Details – Tabular format of all Group Policy Object change events that have been recorded
  in the specified timeframe. See the [Table Card Features](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/siemdashboard/qradar/navigate.md#table-card-features)
  topic for additional information.

The time interval is identified in the upper-right corner with the _Start_ and _End_ boxes. This is
set by default to the past three (3) hours. To search within a different interval, either manually
type the desired date and time or use the calendar buttons to set the desired date and time
interval. Then click **Search** to refresh the card data.

When a search using a time interval longer than twelve (12) hours is instigated, the database query
is broken into multiple mini-queries. This will result in a visible reset of the dashboard display
at the end of each mini-query until all data for the selected time interval has been retrieved.
