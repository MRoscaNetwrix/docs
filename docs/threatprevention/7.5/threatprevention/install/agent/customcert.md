# Create Custom Managed Certificates for Each Agent

If "custom-managed" is selected for the CA certificate configuration during
[Manual Agent Deployment](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/install/agent/manual.md), use the `SIAgentCert.exe` command line utility to facilitate
the creation of certificates for each Agent.

**NOTE:** As a requirement for using custom managed certificates, you must provide the Enterprise
Manager server DNS name, hostname, or FQDN (instead of the IP address) when installing the
following:

- Threat Prevention server
- Remote instance of the Administration Console
- Agent

See the
[Administration Console and Agent Not Communicating with the Enterprise Manager ](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/troubleshooting/enterprisemanagercommunication.md)topics
for additional information.

The `SIAgentCert.exe` utility is located in the following folder:

`…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIWindowsAgent`

Follow the steps to run the `SIAgentCert.exe` utility.

**Step 1 –** Open a command prompt on the machine where the Agent is deployed and run the
SIAgentCert.exe utility as an Administrator. The utility checks for the following files in the
`.…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIWindowsAgent\CertsInfo` folder:

- agent-crt.pem
- agentcsr.pem
- key.pem

If these files are not present because no certificates were previously created, the utility
generates an `agent-key.pem` file and an `agent-csr.pem` and places them in the CertsInfo folder.

**Step 2 –** The `SIAgentCert.exe` utility prompts you to sign the certificate using the generated
`agent-csr.pem` file.

**NOTE:** It is the customer's responsibility to supply the `agent-csr.pem` file to their
certificate authority to create a signed file.

**Step 3 –** Copy the `agent-crt.pem` file created and signed by the customer's certificate
authority to the CertsInfo folder on the machine where the Agent is deployed:

`…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIWindowsAgent\CertsInfo`

**Step 4 –** Verify that Enterprise Manager is running.

**Step 5 –** Run the `SIAgentCert.exe` tool again as an Administrator on the machine where the Agent
is deployed, which will enroll the `agent-crt.pem` file.

**Step 6 –** Start the Agent service. This service has display name as _Netwrix Threat Prevention
Windows Agent_ and service name as _SIWindowsAgent_.

**NOTE:** After Agent deployment, you can configure and upgrade the Agent through the Administration
Console. Upgrades and configuration changes will continue to use the existing certificate.

See the [Upgrade Procedure](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/install/upgrade/overview.md) topic for upgrade considerations. See the
[Upgrade Agent](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/install/upgrade/agent.md) topic for instructions on upgrading an Agent from the
Administration Console.
