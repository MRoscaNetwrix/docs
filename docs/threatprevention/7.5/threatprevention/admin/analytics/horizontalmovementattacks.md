# Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Type

The **Horizontal Movement Attacks** analytic type identifies security principals that are accessing
more than the threshold of resources during the specified time interval.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Configure a subset of accounts and/or servers to be monitored in order to avoid
the excessive volume of event activity from monitoring all.

| Definition                  | User account authentications across multiple network assets in a specified time period                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Example                     | Malware uses several techniques to spread its payload during the initial phase of an attack including Pass the Hash, Impersonation, and current session logged on credentials. Regardless of the method, authentication takes place against other targets on the network, triggering a Threat Prevention horizontal movement alert. |
| Trigger                     | Successful or failed authentications of a given account across X number of resources in Y minutes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Recommended Settings        | Configure this analytic to trigger a hit if Threat Prevention monitors successful or failed authentications of a given account across 10 resources in 3 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                    |

Analytic Workflow

1. Configure the analytic policy
2. Enable the analytic policy
3. Enable alerting on incidents through the
   [System Alerting Window](../configuration/systemalerting/overview.md).

See the Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Data Grid topic for information on event data collected
per incident.

## Configure Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Policy

Open the Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Policy in any of the following ways:

- Click Analytics in the left pane to launch the Analytics interface. Then click the gear icon for
  the analytic.
- Expand the Analytics node and click the desired analytic. On the analytic window, click the gear
  icon available in the top right corner.

The Configure Analytics window has two tabs:

- Settings – Where the analytic trigger is defined
- Policy – Where filters can be added, additional actions configured, a custom schedule set, and the
  policy enabled

Settings Tab

![Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Type - Settings tab](../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/analytics/horizontalattackssettings.webp)

Set the Number of Hosts and the Interval Duration to trigger the incident. The interval duration is
set for (hours:minutes) and is capped at 23:59. When successful or failed authentications of a given
account occurs across the specified number of hosts within the specified interval duration, it will
trigger an incident record.

By default, authentication event data is cached in memory for 24 hours. When an incident is
triggered, an incident record is saved to the database along with the events that triggered the
incident. Raw authentication event data that did not contribute to an incident are purged from
memory once they are more than 24 hours old.

If checked, the Ignore failed logins for unresolved user names option will exclude bad user IDs from
contributing to Horizontal Movement Attacks incidents.

Policy Tab

![Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Type - Policy tab](../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/analytics/policytab.webp)

The **Policy** tab for configuring analytics consists of three sub-tabs:

- General tab – Configured the same way a regular policy’s [General Tab](../policies/general.md) is
  configured. The only exception is that the Name and Description are hard coded, and cannot be
  modified. The Tags field is disabled for analytics.
- Event Type tab – Configured the same way a regular policy’s
  [Event Type Tab](../policies/eventtype/overview.md) is configured. The only exception is that the
  [Authentication Monitoring Event Type](../policies/eventtype/authenticationmonitoring.md) is hard
  coded, and the Success filter cannot be modified.

    - Scope the accounts to include in or exclude from being monitored on the AD Perpetrator filter.
    - \_Optional:\_Scope the protocol to be monitored on the Authentication Protocol filter. If
      enabling the analytic on a domain controller, also scope the login type.

        **NOTE:** The Exclude failed authentications with ‘N-2’ passwords option requires a GPO
        within the organization be configured to ‘Enforce password history’ with a setting of a
        minimum of ‘3 passwords remembered’ or it will not have an effect.

    - \_Optional:\_Scope the domains to be included in or excluded from monitoring on the
      Domains/Servers filter.
    - _Optional:_ Scope the servers to be included in or excluded from monitoring on the IP
      Addresses (from) filter, the IP Addresses (to) filter, the Hosts (from) filter, or the Hosts
      (to) filter.

        **NOTE:** Some authentication events may return only a host name (NetBIOS or FQDN), others
        may return only an IP address. It is recommended to take this into account when entering
        filter values.

- Actions tab – Configured the same way a regular policy’s
  [Actions Tab](../policies/actions/overview.md) is configured. The only exceptions are that the
  “Send to Event DB” and “Email Notifications” options are disabled. The event data collected by
  analytic policies are stored in memory until an incident is triggered. For the “Send Raw Data to
  SIEM” option, use _caution_, as this will send all event data not the triggered incident, which
  could be a large volume of data. To send notifications on incidents, use the
  [System Alerting Window](../configuration/systemalerting/overview.md) to configure Email and SIEM
  alerts.

## Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Data Grid

The data grid on the **Horizontal Movement Attacks** node lists one row per incident identified.

![Horizontal Movement Attacks Analytic Type window](../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/threatprevention/threatprevention/admin/analytics/horizontalmovement.webp)

The data grid can be filtered according to the Event Tracker status: All, New, or Reviewed. See the
[Event Tracker Window](../policies/recentevents/eventtracker.md) topic for additional information.

The top data grid includes the following information for each incident:

- Attacking Account Name – Security principal of the account that triggered the incident

    **NOTE:** The name will be red if the attacking account is the Administrator account.

- Attacking Account SID – Security Identifier of the account used in the event
- First Attempt – Date timestamp of the first monitored event that triggered the incident. Hover
  over the data in this column to view the local time (of the Enterprise Manager) and UTC time
  simultaneously.
- Last Attempt – Date timestamp of the last event that triggered the incident. Hover over the data
  in this column to view the local time (of the Enterprise Manager) and UTC time simultaneously.
- Protocol – Protocol(s) used for the monitored operation
- Number of Attempts – Number of attempts monitored during the specified interval matching this rule
- Number of Hosts – Number of hosts accessed during the specified interval matching this rule

Select an incident in the top data grid to view information on the events that triggered the
incident:

- From Host – Name of the originating host
- From Host IP Address – IP address of the originating host
- To Host – Name of the target host
- To Host IP Address – IP address of the target host
- Protocol – Protocol(s) used for the monitored operation
- Access Type – Type of authentication, e.g. RDP, CIFS, etc.
- Status – Detailed information on the error generated by the event
- Detected on DC – Fully-qualified name of the domain controller that detected the event
- Events Count – Number of identical events that occurred in one minute
- Date/Time – Date timestamp of the monitored event. Hover over the data in this column to view the
  local time (of the Enterprise Manager) and UTC time simultaneously.
- Agent Time Logged – Timestamp for when the Agent detected the event. This can be different from
  the Enterprise Manager time (displayed in the Date/Time column) due to latency.

This data grid employs features for sorting, filtering, searching, and more. See the
[ Data Grid Functionality](../navigation/datagrid.md) topic for additional information.
