# SIEM Output Viewer

The SIEM Output Viewer window displays the event data (messages) that Threat Prevention writes to
syslog (SIEM) in real time.

- Event data generated for a policy is sent to SIEM if the 'Send to SIEM' option is selected for
  that policy on the Actions tab. See the
  [Send to SIEM](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/admin/policies/actions/overview.md#send-to-siem) topic for additional information.
- Event data generated for an analytic is sent to SIEM if the 'Send Raw Data to SIEM' option is
  selected for that analytic on the Actions tab. See the
  [Send to SIEM](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/admin/policies/actions/overview.md#send-to-siem) topic for additional information.
- Event data generated for an event/incident/policy is sent to SIEM if a SIEM profile has been
  assigned to it on the [SIEM Tab](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/admin/configuration/systemalerting/siem.md) of the System Alerting Window.

While you can also use third-party tools like
[Kiwi Syslog Server](https://www.solarwinds.com/free-tools/kiwi-free-syslog-server) to view the
output, the SIEM Output Viewer window may serve as a troubleshooting tool to view and verify the
actual data Threat Prevention sends to syslog (SIEM) in real time.

Follow the steps to view real time data (messages) that Threat Prevention sends to SIEM.

**Step 1 –** Click **Configuration** > **SIEM Output Viewer** on the menu; the SIEM Output Viewer
window opens. This window is only available to Threat Prevention administrators.

**Step 2 –** Click **Start**. As events occur and Threat Prevention writes to syslog (sends
event/policy/analytics data to SIEM) in real time, they are displayed on the window.

**Step 3 –** The **Autoscroll** checkbox enables or disables automatic scrolling of the log display.

- When enabled, the SIEM Output Viewer window automatically scrolls down to show the latest incoming
  messages in real time.
- When disabled, you will have to manually scroll and review log entries without the display
  automatically jumping to the newest message.

**Step 4 –** For each message, the following is displayed:

- Event: Time Logged – Timestamp for when the event was monitored/blocked. The specified time is the
  local time for the server where the Agent is deployed.Hover over the data in this column to view
  the local time (of the Enterprise Manager) and UTC time simultaneously.
- Host – The IP address or name of the SIEM server, configured in the SIEM server settings
- Port – The port number to communicate with the SIEM server, configured in the SIEM server settings
- Protocol – The protocol set when configuring the SIEM server, i.e., TCP or UDP
- SSL – Shows whether SSL is used when sending data to SIEM (applies if TCP is set as the protocol)
- Message – The actual data sent to syslog
- Status – This field is empty if the message is successfully sent. Otherwise, it will contain the
  text of the received error, for example, 'Connection timeout'

You can select a row and use Ctrl+C to copy the data displayed in it. Then paste it to another
application like Notepad to examine it in detail.

**NOTE:** The host, port, protocol, and SSL columns display the settings configured for the SIEM
server where the respective message is sent. See the
[Configure a SIEM Server ](systemalerting/siem.md#configure-a-siem-server) topic for additional
information.

This data grid employs features for sorting, filtering, searching, and more.

- Right-click anywhere in the column header to get a menu with several options to sort the data in
  the grid. See the
  [Data Grid Right-Click Menu](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/admin/navigation/rightclickmenus.md#data-grid-right-click-menu) topic
  for additional information.
- The Group by Box ribbon just above the header row impacts how much data is displayed. See the
  [Sort Data](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/admin/navigation/datagrid.md#sort-data) topic for additional information.
- Columns can be reordered as desired as well as removed from the data grid. Removed columns can be
  added back through the [Customization Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/admin/navigation/datagrid.md#customization-window).
- The Search icon opens the **Enter text to search…** textbox where you can search for the required
  data in the data grid. See the [Search Data](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/threatprevention/admin/navigation/datagrid.md#search-data) topic for
  additional information.

**Step 5 –** Click **Save** to save the displayed data to a text file or **Clear** to clear the
data.

On clicking **Save**, the Safe As dialog box is displayed, where you can select a location to save
the text file.
