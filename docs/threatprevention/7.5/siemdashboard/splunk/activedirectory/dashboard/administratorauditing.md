# Administrator Auditing Dashboard

The Administrator Auditing dashboard is specifically fed by a Threat Prevention policy named Domain
Admin Activity. See the [SIEM Folder Templates](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/templates/folder/siem.md) topic
for information on this policy template. If this policy template is not enabled and actively
monitoring, then this dashboard will be blank.
