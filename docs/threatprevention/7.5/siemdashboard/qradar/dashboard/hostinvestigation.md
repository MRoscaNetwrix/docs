# Host Investigation Dashboard

The Host Investigation dashboard only appears when a search is conducted. This can be done by
clicking a computer-account hyperlink within the Source IP or Destination IP columns of a table
card. Alternatively, type the complete host IP address in the Search box on the right side of the
navigation bar.

The Host Investigation dashboard contains the following cards:

- Total Events from Host – Number of all events associated with the host over the specified time
  interval
- Users – Number of usernames associated with the host over the specified time interval
- Top Users (Authenticating from Host) – Displays up to the top five (5) users associated with the
  host (as source) over the specified time interval
- Top Users (Authenticating to Host) – Displays up to the top five (5) users associated with the
  host (as destination) over the specified time interval
- Activity – Timeline of all events associated with the host over the specified time interval. See
  the [Graph Card Features](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/siemdashboard/qradar/navigate.md#graph-card-features) topic for additional information.
- Latest Events – Tabular format of all events associated with the host that occurred over the
  specified time interval. See the [Table Card Features](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/siemdashboard/qradar/navigate.md#table-card-features) topic
  for additional information.
- Offenses Related to Host – QRadar offenses associated with the host that occurred over the
  specified time interval. See the [Table Card Features](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/siemdashboard/qradar/navigate.md#table-card-features) topic
  for additional information.

The time interval is identified in the upper-right corner with the _Start_ and _End_ boxes. This is
set by default to the past three (3) hours. To search within a different interval, either manually
type the desired date and time or use the calendar buttons to set the desired date and time
interval. Then click **Search** to refresh the card data.

When a search using a time interval longer than twelve (12) hours is instigated, the database query
is broken into multiple mini-queries. This will result in a visible reset of the dashboard display
at the end of each mini-query until all data for the selected time interval has been retrieved.

Additionally, this feature allows you to scope the report data to just Threat Prevention collected
events or to all information within QRadar for the selected host, which opens in another tab. Click
Search and select Threat Prevention from the drop-down menu to refresh the card data or select
QRadar from the drop-down menu to open the host’s List of Events.
