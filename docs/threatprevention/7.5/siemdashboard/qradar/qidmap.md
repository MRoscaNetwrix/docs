# QIDmap Information for QRadar SIEM Integration

Vendors have the ability to create what is called a QIDmap. The purpose of the mapping file is to
create a listing of the events that the vendor can provide. It also creates a mapping that IBM
consumes, producing a DSM. Once the DSM is in place, QRadar can take Threat Prevention events and
categorize them.

The built-in low-level categories have two levels:

- IBM will look to see if it can match the EventID field AND the Event Category field. If a match is
  found, the data will be displayed using the Event Name Threat Prevention supplied in the QIDmap.
  The data will be linked to the defined Low Level Category.

- If no EventID field match is found, IBM will default back to just the Event Category field. The
  fallback ID of 19001 is IBMâ€™s collection of general auditing information.
