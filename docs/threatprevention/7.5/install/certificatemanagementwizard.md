# Certificate Management Wizard

The Certificate Management Wizard is a standalone component used to configure Threat Prevention
Enterprise Manager to use custom managed certificates that are created and signed by an external
certificate authority. This provides customers with the option to use certificates signed by their
certificate authority instead of the default certificate authority in Threat Prevention Enterprise
Manager.

**NOTE:** As a requirement for using custom managed certificates, you must provide the Enterprise
Manager server DNS name, hostname, or FQDN (instead of the IP address) when installing the
following:

- Threat Prevention server
- Remote instance of the Administration Console
- Agent

See the
[Administration Console and Agent Not Communicating with the Enterprise Manager ](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/troubleshooting/enterprisemanagercommunication.md)topics
for additional information.

How to use the Certificate Management Wizard

The Certificate Management Wizard must be run twice to perform two actions.

- The first action creates and exports certificate signing requests to a specified folder.
- The second action installs the signed certificate and configures Threat Prevention Enterprise
  Manager to trust client certificates signed by the customer's certificate authority.

The Certificate Manager Wizard application, `SICertMgr.exe`, is available in the following folder:

...\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager

The Threat Prevention installer generates default certificates, that are located in the following
folder:

...\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager\CertsInfo
