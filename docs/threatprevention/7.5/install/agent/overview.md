# Agent Information

The Threat Prevention Agent performs real-time monitoring of the events occurring across supported
systems and applications. The modules to be installed during Agent deployment are associated with
the Threat Prevention solutions:

- Threat Prevention for Active Directory – Monitoring and blocking Active Directory and Group Policy
  Objects (GPO)

  - Deploy Agents on all domain controllers with the Windows AD Events module
  - For GPO monitoring and blocking, the Threat Prevention Agent on all domain controllers must
    also have the Windows File System module

- Threat Prevention for Enterprise Password Enforcer – Blocking creation of passwords that do not
  meet requirements

  - Deploy Agents on all domain controllers with the Windows AD Events module

- Threat Prevention for Exchange – Monitoring and blocking Exchange environments

  - Deploy Agents on all HUB, CAS, and Mailbox Exchange Servers with the Exchange Server
    Monitoring module
  - Must also deploy Agents on one Active Directory domain controller with the Windows AD Events
    module

- Threat Prevention for File System – Monitoring Windows and NAS file systems, blocking Windows file
  systems

  - For Windows file systems – Deploy Agents on Windows file servers with the Windows File System
    module
  - For NAS file systems – Deploy Agents on the Windows server acting as a proxy server for NAS
    activity (where the Activity Monitor activity agent is deployed) with the Windows File System
    module

- Threat Prevention for LDAP – Monitoring LDAP bind and LDAP queries, blocking LDAP queries

  - Deploy Agents on all domain controllers with the Windows AD Events module

WMI Requirement

The Agent server has the following requirement:

- WMI enabled on the machine, which is optional but required for centralized Agent maintenance

When executing any of the right-click commands on the
[Agents Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/agents/overview.md) (with the exception of Harden Agent, Soften
Agent, and Remove Server from list), the Administration Console uses WMI to remotely query the
registry on the target Agent machine(s) to understand where the Agent configuration files are
located (install path). Next, WMI is used to stop the Agent service, modify the configuration files,
and restart the Agent.

Remember to check [Agent Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/requirements/agent/agent.md) before deploying an
Agent, including the
[Agent Compatibility with Non-Netwrix Security Products](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/requirements/agent/agent.md#agent-compatibility-with-non-netwrix-security-products)
list.

## Domain Controllers

The Agent tracks all events occurring in Active Directory in real-time. The Agent must be installed
on all domain controllers within the domains to be monitored.

Supported Platforms for Microsoft Active Directory

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016

- Windows Server 2025

Netwrix Activity Monitor Integration

Both Activity Monitor and Threat Prevention can monitor the same domain controller. Deploy agents
from both products to the server. Activity Monitor identifies the Windows host as being “Managed by
Threat Prevention” on the Monitored Hosts tab when it detects an Agent on the server. This host's
configuration cannot be modified within the Activity Monitor console. Threat Prevention policies
control the configuration for that monitored host. However, Activity Monitor can be configured to
provide multiple outputs for a host, e.g. for Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor),
Netwrix Threat Manager, or SIEM products. Add a new output for the same host to the Monitored Host
tab in the Activity Monitor console to be used by the other product. See the
[Send Active Directory Event Data from Netwrix Threat Prevention to Netwrix Access Analyzer](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/configuration/accessanalyzerconfiguration.md)
topic for additional information.

## Exchange Servers

The Agent tracks all Owner and Non-Owner information on Exchange Servers in real-time. The Agent
must be installed on all Exchange Servers running the Information Store service within the domains
to be monitored.

To gather Exchange event data that is stored in Active Directory, the Agent must also be installed
on all domain controllers within the domains to be monitored.

If only gathering Exchange event data for mailbox permission changes and mailbox logins, then the
Agent must also be installed on one domain controller, which can be read only.

Supported Platforms for Microsoft Exchange

- Exchange Server 2019
- Exchange Server 2016
- Exchange Server 2013
- Exchange Server 2010

**NOTE:** The Exchange Server Monitoring module is not started on an Agent if newer Exchange Server
updates are detected at run time, and a corresponding message displays in the Agent log file and the
Agents interface.

## Windows File Servers

The Agent monitors all events occurring in the file system in real-time. The Agent must be installed
on all Windows file servers within the domains to be monitored.

Netwrix Activity Monitor Integration

Both Activity Monitor and Threat Prevention can monitor the same Windows server. Deploy agents from
both products to the server. Activity Monitor identifies the Windows host as being “Managed by
Threat Prevention” on the Monitored Hosts tab when it detects an Agent on the server. This host's
configuration cannot be modified within the Activity Monitor console. Threat Prevention policies
control the configuration for that monitored host. However, Activity Monitor can be configured to
provide multiple outputs for a host, e.g. for Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor),
Netwrix Threat Manager, or SIEM products. Add a new output for the same host to the Monitored Host
tab in the Activity Monitor console to be used by the other product. See the
[Send Active Directory Event Data from Netwrix Threat Prevention to Netwrix Access Analyzer](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/configuration/accessanalyzerconfiguration.md)
topic for additional information.
