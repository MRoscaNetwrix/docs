# Filters Section

The Filters section provides options to build a filter statement by selecting the Attribute,
Operator, and Filter value. A time period for the report data is also configured here. If multiple
data sources have been configured, there is also a Source drop-down menu.. Filter statements can be
simple with one value statement or complex with multiple value statements.

Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the Investigations interface. Then
create a new investigation or click a folder in the navigation pane to access a saved investigation.
An investigation is located in the folder where it was saved.

Click the arrow on the right side to expand or collapse the Filters section.

The following options are available for configuring a filter statement:

- Source – This menu provides a list of all integrations with the application. If there is only one
  data source configured, the Source menudisplays that only. See the
  [Netwrix Integrations Page](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/integrations/netwrixintegrations.md) topic for
  additional information.
- Timeframe – This menu provides several timeframe options as well as a clock and a calendar for
  setting a custom range. You must set the timeframe for the data to be returned in the report. If
  your report is blank, it is likely due to the timeframe setting. See the Timeframe topic for
  additional information.
- Attribute – This menu provides a list of attributes that are available on events in the data
  source. See the Filter Attribute Menu topic for additional information.
- Operator – This menu controls how the rule is evaluated by specifying the comparison between the
  Attribute and the Filter value. Options vary based on the selected attribute. See the Filter
  Operator Menu topic for additional information.
- Filter – Use it to specify the value to evaluate using the operator for the selected attribute
- Add – This appears in a new row of the Filter table, in the Attribute column. Clicking it opens
  the Attribute menu to add another filter statement.
- X icon – This icon removes the respective filter statement

See the Build a Filter Statement topic for additional information.

## Timeframe

You must set a timeframe for an investigation query. When you run a query, the application scans the
available data for activity events that match the set filters for the specified timeframe. By
default, the timeframe is set for the "Last Hour" of activity.

![Investigations Interface showing the Timeframe drop-down menu](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/investigations/options/timeframe.webp)

Click the displayed timeframeto open a window, which provides several timeframe options as well as a
clock and a calendar for setting a custom range:

- Preset timeframes:

  - Last Hour
  - Last 4 Hours
  - Last 8 Hours
  - Last 24 Hours
  - Last 5 Days
  - Last 7 Days
  - Last 14 Days
  - Last 30 Days

- Custom timeframe – Specified by the start and end date and time range set in the clock / calendar
  section

:::note
The timeframe property is saved with the investigation filters. However, it can be
modified to run a query ad hoc with the same filter statement but a different timeframe.
:::


**Configure a Custom Timeframe Range**

Follow the steps to configure a custom timeframe range.

**Step 1 –** On the Investigations interface, select the desired Investigation or start a new
investigation.

**Step 2 –** Click the Timeframe displayed in the Filters section.

**Step 3 –** Set the start date on the left. You can either type it in the box at the top or
navigate through the calendar to select the desired date.

**Step 4 –** Set the start time on the left. You can either type it in the box at the top or click
the clock icon within the box to get a menu for selecting the hour, minute, and period (AM or PM).

**Step 5 –** Set the end date on the right. You can either type it in the box at the top or navigate
through the calendar to select the desired date.

**Step 6 –** Set the end time on the right. You can either type it in the box at the top or click
the clock icon within the box to get a menu for selecting the hour, minute, and period (AM or PM).

**Step 7 –** Click **Apply**.

The Timeframe window closes and the custom range is visible in the Filters section. Save the changes
to the selected investigation, unless you are running an ad hoc query.

## Filter Attribute Menu

The Attribute menu in the Filters sectionhas the following options grouped by the type of attribute:

## Build a Filter Statement

You can create a filter for a new investigation or modify a filter for a saved investigation. Follow
the steps to build a filter statement.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the desired investigation's Filters section.

![filtersimple](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/investigations/options/filtersimple.webp)

**Step 2 –** If multiple data sources are configure, select a source from the **Source** drop-down
menu.

**Step 3 –** Set the timeframe for the event data to be returned in the report.

**Step 4 –** Select an attribute from the Attribute drop-down menu.

**Step 5 –** Select an operator from the Operator drop-down menu.

**Step 6 –** Enter a value in the Filter box. Possible values available from the events will
populate in a drop-down menu as you type. Select the desired value from the drop-down menu. If the
value you type is not available in the drop-down menu, use the Add button to add it to the Filter
box.

:::note
Adding additional values in the same Filter box will add an OR statement for the
attribute. For example:
:::


- When:

  - Attribute = Perpetrator; Operator = Equals; Filter = nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne,
    nwxtech\ad.robin.locksley

- Then the query will return activity for nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne OR nwxtech\ad.robin.locksley

**Step 7 –** To form a complex filter with multiple attributes, click **Add** to insert a new row
and repeat steps 4-6. The AND operator is automatically applied to group multiple rows. For example:

- When:

  - Attribute = Perpetrator; Operator = Equals; Filter = nwxtech\domain admins

- AND

  - Attribute = Perpetrator; Operator = Not Equal to; Filter = nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne

- Then the query will return activity for all domain admins except nwxtech\ad.bruce.wayne

:::note
Click the X at the end of a row to remove it from the statement.
:::


Once the filter is set, you can generate the report ad hoc by clicking **Run Query**. The allows you
to test if your filter statement is working as desired. Save the investigation for reuse. You can
also add subscriptions or export the report data using the options above the Filters section.

See the [Investigation Reports](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/investigations/reports/reports.md) topic for additional information.
