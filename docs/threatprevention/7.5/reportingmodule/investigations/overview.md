# Investigations Interface

The Investigation interface allows administrators to investigate all data available to the
application through a series of customizable filters. These investigations can be saved so they can
be run ad hoc at a later time.Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the
Investigations interface.

If you have not integrated the Threat Manager Reporting module with a Netwrix product, the interface
is displayed as:

[Netwrix Integrations Page](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/integrations/netwrixintegrations.md) topic.

After integration, when you click **Investigate** in the application header bar, the Investigations
interface defaults to the New Investigation page as follows:
