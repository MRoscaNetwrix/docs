# Predefined Investigations Page

The Predefined Investigations page in the Investigations interface provides a list of saved
out-of-the-box investigations with applied filters for Computers, Groups, iNetOrgPerson, and User
activity reports.

Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the Investigations interface. Then click
**Predefined Investigations** in the navigation pane. This expands the menu to display the folders
containing predefined investigations. Expand a folder to view the investigations under it. To get a
list of all the predefined investigations in the adjacent pane, hover your mouse over the Predefined
Investigations option and click the icon that is displayed.

The table displays the list of investigations with the following columns:

- Name – The name of the investigation
- Favorite – The check mark indicates that the investigation has been tagged as a favorite for the
  logged in user

Click an investigation to view it. You can run the query, modify the configuration, add a
subscription, or export the report. See the [Investigation Options](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/investigations/options/overview.md) topic for
additional information on saved investigation options.

Every report generated by an investigation query displays the same type of information. See the
[Investigation Reports](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/investigations/reports.md) topic for additional information.

By default, these investigations are grouped in subfolders. Each subfolder page has the same table
as the Predefined Investigations page, scoped to the investigations within that folder.
