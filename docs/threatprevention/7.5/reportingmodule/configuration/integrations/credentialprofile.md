# Credential Profile Page

The Credential Profile page within the Integrations interface lists all of the credentials used by
the application to complete tasks. These credentials are securely stored.

Use the gear icon in the upper right corner of the console to open the Configuration menu. Then
select **Integrations** to open the Integrations interface.

Click **Credential Profile** in the navigation pane to view a list of the already created Credential
Profiles, if any.

The table displays the user name for each profile. To view profile details or make modifications,
select a profile from the table or under Credential Profile in the navigation pane.

See the [Reporting Module Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/requirements/reportingserver.md) topic for a
list of permission requirements for each type of task.

Best Practice Recommendation

- Create a Credential Profile with Writer permissions to the shared folder where subscription
  exports will be stored
