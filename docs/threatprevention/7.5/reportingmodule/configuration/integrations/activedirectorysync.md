# Active Directory Sync Page

The Active Directory Sync page within the Integrations interface lists the domains that are synced
to theNetwrix Threat Manager Reporting Module database. The sync operation gets all information
about an Active Directory environment (users, groups, hosts, etc).

Use the gear icon in the upper right corner of the console to open the Configuration menu. Then
select **Integrations** to open the Integrations interface.

Click **Active Directory Sync** in the navigation pane to view a list of the already added Active
Directory domains, if any. Each added domain represents a sync policy.

![Integrations interface on the Active Directory Sync page](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/integrations/page.webp)

A service named StealthDEFEND Active Directory Service continuously runs to collect data for the
specified domain(s). It evaluates the USN value of an object and syncs when the object changes. The
table provides the following information:

- Name – Name of the domain. This may be either the domain DNS name or domain controller hostname.
- Enabled – The icon indicates the enabled state:

  - Checkmark icon – Enabled
  - X icon – Disabled

- Profile – Name of the Credential Profile assigned to the policy. As mentioned earlier, each added
  domain represents a sync policy.
- Last Sync Start – Date timestamp when the task started for the most recent sync
- Last Sync Status – Event status for the most recent sync task

To view policy details or make modifications, select a domain from the table or under Active
Directory Sync in the navigation pane.

## Add an Active Directory Sync Policy

:::note
Prior to adding an Active Directory Sync policy, you must first configure a Credential
Profile with credentials properly provisioned for running the sync operation for the domain. See the
[Reporting Module Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/requirements/reportingserver.md) topic for the
permissions. See the [Credential Profile Page](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/integrations/credentialprofile.md) topic for additional
information on creating a profile.

Follow the steps to add a domain/Active Directory sync policy.

**Step 1 –** Use the gear icon in the upper right corner of the console to open the Configuration
menu. Then select **Integrations** to open the Integrations interface.

**Step 2 –** On the Integrations interface, click Add New Integration in the navigation pane. The
Add New Integration window opens.

![Add New Integration window with Active Directory Sync type selected](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/integrations/activedirectorysync.webp)

**Step 3 –** In the Type drop-down menu, select Active Directory Sync.

**Step 4 –** Enter the following information:

- Domain – Enter the domain DNS name or domain controller hostname in the required format of
  [DOMAIN.COM], e.g. NT-DC03.NWXTech.com

  pre-created in the Credential Profiles page.
- Enabled / Disabled – Toggle indicates if the policy is enabled to run the sync service. By default
  it is set to Enabled.
- Max Renew Ticket Age (days) – The value indicates the maximum number of days of the Renew Ticket
  Age for the domain. This value must match the domain configuration. See the Microsoft
  [Max-Renew-Age attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-maxrenewage)
  article for additional information. The default value is 7 days; modify the value by typing in the
  textbox.
- Max Ticket Age (hours) – The value indicates the maximum number of hours of the Ticket Age for the
  domain. This value must match the domain configuration. See the Microsoft
  [Max-Ticket-Age attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-maxticketage)
  article for additional information. The default value is 10 hours; modify the value by typing in
  the textbox.
- Use SSL – Check the box to enable SSL for secure communication with the domain. See the Microsoft

  article for additional information.

**Step 5 –** Click **Test Connection** to ensure connection to the domain. This will take a moment.
Then a message will appear in the upper right corner of the console indicating a successful or
failed connection.If successful, move on to the next step. If failed, recheck your entries for error
and repeat this step until a successful connection is established.

**Step 6 –** Click Add. The Add New Integration window closes.
