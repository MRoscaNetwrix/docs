# Folder Settings Page

The Folder Settings page within the Integrations interface allows users to designate the
Investigation exports folder location. Additionally, a shared folder can be provided for
subscription purposes.

Use the gear icon in the upper right corner of the console to open the Configuration menu. Then
select **Integrations** to open the Integrations interface.

Click **Folder Settings** in the navigation pane.

By default, Investigation exports are placed in the Downloads folder of the logged in user, on the
machine where that user is accessing the application. When a Local Folder path is designated, all
Investigation exports are also stored in the specified folder on the application server.

When shared folders are added, they are displayed in a table at bottom of the page.

The Shared Folders table has the following columns:

- Display Name – The name of the shared folder as displayed in the application
- Path to the Shared folder – The path to the shared folder where subscription reports are stored
- Credential Profile – Name of the Credential Profile
- Access – The users that can save their subscription exports to the shared folder
- Last Time tested – Date timestamp when the the shared folder was tested to ensure it is configured
  correctly

Additional Options

When you hover over a row within the Shared Folders table, three additional options are displayed:

changes before leaving the page.

Investigation exports will now be saved to the designated local folder on the application server.

## Add a Shared Folder

**NOTE:** Prior to adding a shared folder, you must first configure a Credential Profile with Write
access to the shared folder. See the [Credential Profile Page](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/integrations/credentialprofile.md) topic for
creating a profile.

You can specify a shared folder for exporting investigations data from subscriptions through the
Integrations menu. Follow the steps to add a shared folder.

**Step 1 –** Use the gear icon in the upper right corner of the console to open the Configuration
menu. Then select **Integrations** to open the Integrations interface.

**Step 2 –** On the Integrations interface, click **Folder Settings** in the navigation pane.

**Step 3 –** Click **Add Shared Folder**. The Add New Shared Folder window opens.

**Step 4 –** Enter the following information:

- Display Name – Enter a name of the shared folder as displayed in the application
- Credential Profile – Select the Credential Profile by name from the drop-down menu. This was
  pre-created in the Credential Profiles page.
- Path – Enter a valid share path with the \\[SERVER NAME]\[PATH TO SHARED FOLDER] format. For
  example, \\NT-FS02\Subscriptions.
- Access – Allow specific users to access the folder when configuring subscriptions in the
  application. By default, this is set to All users. To limit access, select users from the
  drop-down menu. Only users granted application access through the System Settings > User Access
  page will be available in the drop-down.

**Step 5 –** Click **Add**. The Add New Shared Folder window closes.

The specified shared folder has been configured for subscription exports.
