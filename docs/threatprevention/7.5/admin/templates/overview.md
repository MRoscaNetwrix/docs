The following is displayed for a template:

- Name
- Path – Location within the Navigation pane
- Description

The list of templates can be sorted alphanumerically ascending or descending by clicking on a column
header. An arrow appears in the right corner of the column header indicating the type of sorting.
You can also right-click a template to get a right-click menu.

Templates Node

Under the Templates node in the Navigation pane, folders are used to organize the templates. Folders
can be created at the top level or as sub-folders since Threat Prevention supports unlimited levels
for organizing templates. The pre-created templates are organized into multiple folders. See the
[Pre-Created Templates](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/templates/folder/overview.md) topic for additional information.

- Click a template to open it and view its configurations. See the
  [Template Configuration](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/templates/configuration/configuration.md) topic for additional information.
- You can move a templates from one folder to another by dragging-and-dropping. This is a Move
  action.
- You can also drag a template into a folder under the Policies node. This would be a Copy action,
  and converts the template into a policy. See the
  [Use a Template to Create a Policy](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/templates/createpolicy.md) topic for additional information.

## Right-Click Menu

Each template listed in the Templates interface has a right-click menu. Select a template and
right-click to open this menu.
