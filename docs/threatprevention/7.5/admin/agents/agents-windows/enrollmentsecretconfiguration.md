# Enrollment Secret Configuration Window

The Enrollment Secret is a limited-life (1 hour) password generated by the Enterprise Manager. The
Agent Installer uses it to ensure that the Agent is connected to a legitimate Enterprise Manager. It
enables the automatic exchange of certificates between the Enterprise Manager and theAgent. How the
enrollment secret is applied depends on the method used to install the Agent.

- If using the Administration Console to deploy the Agent, the console will automatically generate
  and use a new enrollment secret as part of automated Agent installation.
- If installing the Agent manually, the enrollment secret must be entered in the Certificates window
  of the Agent Setup wizard during installation. See the
  [Manual Agent Deployment](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/install/agent/manual/manual.md) topic for additional information.

Follow the steps to generate the enrollment secret.

**Step 1 –** Click **Agents** in the left pane to launch the Agents interface. Then click **Agent
Enrollment Secret** to launch the Enrollment Secret Configuration window.

The Enrollment Secret Configuration window enables you to generate the enrollment secret required to
manually deploy the Agent. It has the following fields:

- Enrollment Secret – A limited-life (1 hour) password generated by the Enterprise Manager. The
  Agent Installer uses it to ensure that the Agent is connected to a legitimate Enterprise Manager.
- Expires in – The expiration date timestamp for the enrollment secret
- EM cert – The Enterprise Manager certificate generated by the certificate authority for use by the
  Enterprise Manager to establish trust between the Enterprise Manager and other modules including
  the Agent

  - Note the value of the Enterprise Manager certificate (EM cert) and verify that it is the same
    value displayed in the Agent installer to ensure that the Agent is connecting to a legitimate
    Enterprise Manager.

**Step 2 –** Click **Generate** to generate an enrollment secret, which is valid for 1 hour.

- When deploying the Agent from the Administration Console, a new enrollment secret is automatically
  created, which invalidates any previous secret that has not expired. .
- Click **Copy** to copy the enrollment secret and enter it in the Certificates window of the Agent
  Setup wizard during manual Agent installation.

:::note
Restarting the Enterprise Manager cancels the current enrollment secret.
