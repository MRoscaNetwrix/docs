# Installing Window

The Deploy Agents wizard's Installing window is the last in a sequence of four windows to deploy the
Agent on a computer. This window performs the desired action, tracks the deployment process, and
displays a successful or failed status.

It displays the working and completed status of the action. Depending on whether the Agent is
deployed successfully, the Message column displays a failed message with additional text or a
successful message if the Agent is deployed correctly.

To stop the deployment process on any machines that have not yet started deployment, click Cancel.
The Close button changes to a Finish button once all Agents are deployed.
