# Upgrade ADMonitor

You can update the instrumentation DLL, SI.ActiveDirectoryMonitor.dll (commonly known as ADMonitor
DLL), in LSASS without having to upgrade the entire Agent. To facilitate this, the
[Agents Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/agents/overview.md) displays the currently installed versions of the Agent and the
ADMonitor DLL.

**NOTE:** The Agent and the ADMonitor DLL should have the same major/minor version, such as 7.5.x.x,
where x.x for the DLL can be equal or higher than that of the Agent. Example: Agent 7.5.0.123 and
DLL 7.5.0.777

In previous Threat Prevention versions, you had to uninstall the Agent and then reinstall it just to
update the ADMonitor DLL. With Threat Prevention 7.5, the _Upgrade ADMonitor_ feature enables you to
simply replace the DLL without having to uninstall and reinstall the Agent.

Follow the steps to update ADMonitor.

**Step 1 –** Click **Agents** in the left pane to launch the Agents interface.

**Step 2 –** Right-click a server/Agent and select **Upgrade ADMonitor** on the menu.

**Step 3 –** On the Access Verification window, the system runs a check to verify if the Agent is
accessible. If yes, Success is displayed in the Status column. Click **Next** to proceed.

**Step 4 –** The Upgrade AD Monitor window displays the ADMonitor upgrade progress. Progress
statuses are:

- Starting – Indicates that the ADMonitor update operation is about to start
- Started – The ADMonitor update operation has successfully started and it is in progress. You may
  close the window as the process will complete on its own.
- Failed – Read the failure messages and close the window. Ensure any error messages are taken care
  of prior to the next attempt.

**Step 5 –** When the upgrade completes, click **Close**.

ADMonitor has been updated.
