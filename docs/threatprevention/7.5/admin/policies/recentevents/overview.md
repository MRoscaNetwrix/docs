# Recent Events Tab

The Recent Events tab provides information on the events that have been recently monitored or
blocked by the selected policy. See the [Investigate Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/investigate/overview.md) for
recent events monitored or blocked by all policies. You can also view event data configured to be
sent to syslog (SIEM) on the [SIEM Output Viewer](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/configuration/siemoutputviewer.md) window.

The Recent Events tab has the following options on the toolbar:

- Recent [number] Events – Populates the data grid with the most recent events from the active
  policy. Use the textbox to change the default number, i.e., 100.
- Events for Last [number] Hours –  Populates the data grid with hourly events. Use the textbox to
  change the default number of hours, i.e., 3.
- Range From/To – Displays the events that occurred within the given timeframe
- Refresh button – Updates the grid with any new events
- Show All Columns – Resets hidden columns to their default location on the data grid
- Export Data– Opens the Export Data window with export actions and options. See the
  [Export Data](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/navigation/datagrid.md#export-data) topic for additional information.

Example for the Events for Last [number] Hours Option

Below is an example of how to use the Events for Last [number] Hours option:

The number of hours set is based on UTC and is adjusted for the time zones of the Administration
Console server and the Agent that is monitoring the events. Let's assume the following:

- The Administration Console server is in New York, USA (UTC -5)
- The option is set to display events for Last 4 Hours
- The Agent that is monitoring the events is in London, UK (UTC +0)

If you click the Refresh button at noon New York time, then the events displayed would have been
generated between 8 A.M. and 12 P.M. New York time, or between 1 P.M. and 5 P.M. London time.

The data grid can be filtered according to the Event Tracker Status:

- All
- New
- Reviewed

See the [Event Tracker Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/recentevents/eventtracker.md) topic for additional information.
