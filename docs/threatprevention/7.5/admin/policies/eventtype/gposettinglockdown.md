# GPO Setting Lockdown Event Type

The GPO Setting Lockdown event type can prevent all changes against specified GPOs. Note that this
is for the entire GPO (file) and not specific settings in the GPO.

The event filters for the GPO Setting Lockdown event type are:

- AD Group Policy Object
- Domains/Servers
- AD Perpetrator

Each filter tab acts like an "AND" statement for the filter. Any filter tab left blank is treated
like an "ALL" for that filter set.

If setting a filter to “Exclude” a domain from this blocking policy, this setting overrides any
”Block” user filters. This means that in order to block a user, you must not “Exclude” the domain
where that user resides.

**CAUTION:** Lockdown/blocking policies with blank filters result in everything being locked down or
blocked.

## AD Group Policy Object Filter

Use the AD Group Policy Object filter to set the scope of the policy to lockdown specific GPOs.

from being locked down.
