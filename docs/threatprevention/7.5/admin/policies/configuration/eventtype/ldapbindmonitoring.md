# LDAP Bind Monitoring Event Type

The LDAP Bind Monitoring event type monitors all connections established with LDAP, including the
users who connected with LDAP. While the [LDAP Monitoring Event Type](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/configuration/eventtype/ldapmonitoring/ldapmonitoring.md) creates
events when actual LDAP queries are executed, LDAP Bind Monitoring creates events when a connection
is established with LDAP.

The event filters for the LDAP Bind Monitoring event type are:

- Bind Protocol
- Domains/Servers
- Success
- AD Perpetrator
- IP Addresses (from)
- Hosts (from)

![Policy window - LDAP Bind Monitoring Event Type](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/eventtype/ldapbind.webp)

Each filter tab acts like an "AND" statement for the filter. Any filter tab left blank is treated
like an "ALL" for that filter set.

This event type can only be used in a policy by itself or with another LDAP event type. This means
that:

- If you select this event type, all other event types will be grayed out except the LDAP event
  types
- If you select an event type other than LDAP, this event type will be grayed out

## Bind Protocol Filter

The Bind Protocol filter determines if events should be captured for an LDAP bind operation based on
the security protocol used by the bind operation.

![Policy window - Bind Protocol filter](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/eventtype/bindprotocol.webp)

Select **All** to report on any LDAP bind that used any protocol.

You can also limit Threat Prevention to capture LDAP bind events only when one of the selected
protocol(s) are used.

- SSL
- StartTLS
- Signed
- Signed and Sealed
- None – To capture events for an LDAP bind operation that did not use any of the secure protocols

## Domains/Servers Filter

Use the Domains/Servers filter to set the scope of the policy to specific domains and/or servers or
to exclude specific domains and/or servers.

![Event Type - Domains/Servers Monitoring filter](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/eventtype/domainsserversmonitoring.webp)

Collection. See the [Dynamic Collections](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/configuration/collectionmanager/dynamic.md) topic

## Success Filter

The Success filter is where the policy is set to only monitor successful events, failed events, or
both.

![Event Type – Success filter](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/eventtype/success.webp)

- Failure – Only monitors failed events
- Both Success and Failure – Monitors all events that are within the scope of the respective filters
  for the event type

## AD Perpetrator Filter

Use the AD Perpetrator filter for monitoring to set the scope of the policy to only monitor specific
security principals committing changes or to exclude specific security principals committing changes
from being monitored.

When contexts are added, a Sub-Tree checkbox displays. Check it to apply the filter to the parent
and all child contexts. Uncheck it to apply the filter to the listed context only.

## IP Addresses (from) Filter

Use the IP Addresses (from) filter to set the scope of the policy to specific IP addresses as
originators of an event or to exclude specific IP addresses.

![Event Type – IP Addresses (from) filter](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/eventtype/ipaddressesfrom.webp)

Use the Hosts (from) filter for monitoring to set the scope of the policy to only monitor specific
hosts as originators of an event or to exclude specific hosts from being monitored.
