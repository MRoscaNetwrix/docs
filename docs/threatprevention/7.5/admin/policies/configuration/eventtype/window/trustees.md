# Select Active Directory Trustees Window

The Select Active Directory Trustees window provides a list of available Exchange trustees to either
include or exclude. Selected objects are added to the filter from where you clicked the **Add** (+)
button to open this window.

Trustees are the objects that rights are assigned to, e.g. Exchange mailboxes or Exchange
distribution lists.
