**Step 3 –** Enter the name of the desired user in the Enter the object names to select box and
click Check Name. On the next window, select the required Active Directory user and click **OK**.
Click **OK** on the Select Users or Groups window to close it. The user is added to the Windows User
or Group list.

**Step 4 –** At the bottom of the Users and Roles window, two user roles, Administrator and Console
Operator, are displayed. Select the checkbox for a role to assign it to the user. Checking
Administrator automatically checks the Console Operator role.

_Remember,_ the Report User role was a legacy role for the IIS-based SI Reporting Console and does
not apply to the Netwrix Threat Manager Reporting Module console. See the
[User Access Page](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/reportingmodule/configuration/systemsettings/useraccess.md) topic for
information on granting report access.

**Step 5 –** _(Optional)_ Create as many users as required before clicking OK.

**Step 6 –** Click **OK** to save changes on the Users and Roles window.

User(s) now have the appropriate access rights applied.
