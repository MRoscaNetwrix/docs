The Event database is originally configured when installing the Threat Prevention Enterprise Manager
package. See the [Application Server Install](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/install/application.md) topic for additional
information. This window displays the current connection settings for the Event database.

Credentials and/or SQL Server host information can be changed in the DB Connection Manager
application. See the [DB Connection Manager Wizard](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/install/dbconnectionmanager.md) topic for
additional information.
