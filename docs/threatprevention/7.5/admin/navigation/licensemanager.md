# License Manager Window

The License Manager window displays the Threat Prevention modules that you are licensed for. If
under an Enterprise license, it also displays an expiration date. On license expiry, the Enterprise
Manager will refuse events from all Agents.

_Remember,_ if events are not received and displayed in the Administration Console, check if your
license has expired.

Generate Alerts when the License Nears Expiration

You can configure alerts to be sent when the.Threat Prevention license nears expiration. These
alerts serve as a reminder for license renewal.

To generate license expiration alerts 14 days prior to license expiry, enable the **License** option
on the [System Alerting Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/configuration/systemalerting/overview.md). Go to the Email, Event
Log or SIEM tab depending on how you want to receive alerts (i.e., by email, in the Windows event
log, or in a SIEM product) and click Configuration in the left pane to locate the License option for
enabling it.

The first alert is generated 14 days prior to license expiry and then every following day at 9:00
AM. You can customize the time by modifying the following entry in the
SIEnterpriseManager.exe.config file:

<add key="timeOfLicenseChecking" value="9:00"/>

File path: `...\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager`

## View Licensing Information

This window lists the modules that you are licensed for. Each module is linked to a Threat
Prevention solution.

Following is a list of the solutions with their respective modules. You can also view the event
types available with each module.

**NOTE:** The Password Enforcement module is available under all licenses for monitoring weak
passwords. However, you need the Enterprise Password Enforcer solution license to block weak
passwords.
