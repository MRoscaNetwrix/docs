The Threat Prevention Administration Console is used to:

- Create and configure policies and policy templates
- Configure analytics
- Deploy and manage Agents
- Import and export Threat Prevention policies and policy templates
- Configure alerts

Policies control the real-time event monitoring/blocking of files and directories, users, groups,
Active Directory objects, and Microsoft Exchange objects. These policies enable Threat Prevention to
detect and report changes as well as send notification when changes occur.

## Administration Console Components

The Administration Console has the following components:

- Menu
- Policy Center
- Status Bar

There are also right-click commands available within different sections of the Policy Center.

If the Administration Console user interface or windows do not display properly, see the
[Troubleshooting FAQs](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/troubleshooting/overview.md#troubleshooting-faqs) topic for

## Policy Center

The Policy Center is the primary interface of the Administration Console. It is divided into two
sections: the Navigation pane and the Display area.

![Administration Console – Policy Center](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/navigation/policycenter.webp)

The Navigation pane provides interface options while the Display area displays the selected
interface. The following interface options are available:

- [Agents Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/agents/overview.md)
- [Alerts Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/alerts/overview.md)
- [Investigate Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/investigate/overview.md)
- [Analytics Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/analytics/overview.md)
- [Policies Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/policies/overview.md)
- [Templates Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/templates/overview.md)
- [Tags Node](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/tags.md)

Several right-click menus and additional features are available within these interfaces.

:::tip
Remember, the Investigate, Analytics, Policies, Templates, and TAGS nodes in the Navigation pane
can be expanded and collapsed.
:::


Agents

The Agents interface provides data about the Agents within the environment. This includes what
domain the Agent is in, what machine it is deployed on, its current status, and other details. This
interface also indicates if a domain controller does NOT have an Agent deployed on it. Through this
interface, Agents can be deployed, updated, and managed; logging levels can be configured; logs can
be accessed; and Agent information can be exported.

Alerts

The Alerts interface provides information on the Threat Prevention Security events, Operations
events, and Configuration events. All events are displayed by default. However, they can be
filtered, sorted, and searched.

Investigate

The Investigate interface is a reporting tool for the Administration Console. It provides
information on recent events monitored or blocked by any enabled policy. By default, all events
recently monitored or blocked are available. However, they can be filtered to particular policies,
perpetrators, time frames, domains, servers, computers, events, etc.

Analytics

The Analytics interface is a front-line warning tool for detecting incidents in real-time based on
patterns within collected event data indicative of potential security risk. It provides information
on incidents identified by the analytic policies.

Policies

The Policies interface provides a central location for creating and configuring all policies. On
selecting the Policy node, the policies are listed in the Display area. In the Navigation pane, the
policies are organized into folders. By default, the folder structure is comprised of but not
limited to three folders: Auditing, Blocking, and Notifications, representing the most common types
of policies enabled by users. Policies can be configured to monitor or block Windows Active
Directory events, Windows Exchange Server 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 events, Windows File System
events, NetApp File System events, EMC File System events, and Group Policy Objects events.

A folder can be protected, which controls access to any policy within the folder. A protected policy
cannot be viewed, edited, or deleted by other Administration Console users without explicit
permissions being granted.

Templates

The Templates interface provides a central location for creating and configuring all policy
templates. On selecting the Templates node, a list of all policy templates available is displayed in
the Display area. Policy templates must also be stored within a folder. There are pre-created policy
templates which can be imported.

TAGS

The TAGS node provides an organizational feature for templates. Many preconfigured templates have
tags which enable users to quickly find a desired template though various groupings. Tags do not
create a duplicate template, but rather display the template in different folders under the TAGS
node.

## Status Bar

The Status Bar is located at the bottom of the Administration Console.

![statusbar](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/navigation/statusbar.webp)

It displays the current user account logged into Threat Prevention and current session details.
