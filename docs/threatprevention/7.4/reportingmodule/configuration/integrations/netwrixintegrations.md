Integrations with other Netwrix products enables you to run Investigations on the event data within
the connected database. When you add a Netwrixintegration, the selection for Default Data Source
identifies which database is the default source for Investigation reports. You can change it by
selecting a different database from the drop-down menu. The table provides the following
information:

- Name – The name of the integration, as supplied when it was added
- Host – The name of the database host
- Catalog – The name of the database
- Profile – The Name of the Credential Profile assigned to the integration
- Description – Integration description, as supplied when it was added

To view integration details or make modifications, select an integration from the list or under
Netwrix Integrations in the navigation pane.

## Add a Netwrix Integration

**NOTE:** Prior to adding a Netwrix Integration, you must first configure a Credential Profile with
credentials properly provisioned for connecting to the database. See the
[Reporting Module Server Requirements](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/requirements/reportingserver.md)
topic for the permissions. See the
[Credential Profile Page](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/reportingmodule/configuration/integrations/credentialprofile.md)
topic for additional information on creating a profile.

  - Named instance, use `[SQLHostName]\[SQLInstanceName]`, for example `NT-SQL02\Netwrix`
