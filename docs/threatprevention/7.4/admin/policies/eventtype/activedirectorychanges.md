# Active Directory Changes Event Type

The Active Directory Changes event type can be configured to generate an event when an Active
Directory object or attribute is changed (add, delete, modify, move, rename).

The event filters for the Active Directory Changes event type are:

- AD Event
- Domains/Servers
- AD Context
- AD Classes
- AD Attributes
- AD Objects
- AD Perpetrator
- IP Addresses (from)
- Hosts (from)
- Success

![Policy window - Active Directory Changes Event Type](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/eventtype/adchanges.webp)

Each filter tab acts like an "AND" statement for the filter. Any filter tab left blank is treated
like an "ALL" for that filter set.

## AD Event Filter

Use the AD Event filter to select Active Directory events to be monitored or locked down by the
policy.

![Policy window - AD Event filter](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/eventtype/adevent.webp)

Check the **All** box to monitor or lockdown all operations, or select specific operations:

- Object Added – The policy monitors for objects being added to Active Directory
- Object Deleted – The policy monitors for objects being deleted from Active Directory
- Object Modified – The policy monitors for Active Directory objects being modified
- Object Moved or Renamed – The policy monitors for Active Directory objects being moved or renamed

If applied to a Lockdown Event Type, the policy both monitors and lockdowns the objects based on the
selection.

## Domains/Servers Filter

Use the Domains/Servers filter to set the scope of the policy to specific domains and/or servers or
to exclude specific domains and/or servers.

Active Directory or to exclude specific classes from being monitored.

Directory attributes or to exclude specific attributes from being monitored.

Attribute, Operator and Value

When an attribute is selected, it is added to the filter and a drop-down menu is displayed in the
Operation column with **Any Value** selected. You can further scope the attributes to enable the
policy to only capture events based on the new value. Use the Operation and Value columns of the
Include Attributes and Exclude Attributes boxes to achieve this.

The Operation drop-down menu has the following options:

- Any Value – No scoping applied for this attribute
- (empty value) – Blank attribute values
- Equal – Attribute values that are identical to the Value field
- Not Equal – Attribute values that do not match the Value field
- Less Than – Attribute values below the numeric value or before the alphabetical value supplied in
  the Value field
- Greater Than – Attribute values above the numeric value or after the alphabetical value supplied
  in the Value field
- Contains – Attribute value includes the user supplied string (numbers are treated as strings) in
  the Value field
- Not Contain – Attribute values do not include the user supplied string (numbers are treated as
  strings) in the Value field
- Starts with – Attribute values start with the user supplied string in the Value field

Select an **Operation** and type a value in the textbox. The value may include alphanumeric
characters, string type, or dates. Only one value is supported; do not specify multiple values for
the attribute. Also the Value field is not case sensitive.

When you select another attribute, a new row is added, where you can specify an operator and a value
for that attribute. Each row is treated as an “OR” statement. If any event matches any of the
attribute filters, then the event data includes all attributes in the list.

**NOTE:** You cannot specify more than one value for an attribute and you cannot select the same
attribute twice. To use the same attribute again, you have to add the same event type again to the
policy, select that event type and then select a previously used attribute to include in the Add
Attributes filter.

When the userAccountControl attribute is included or excluded in the filter, selecting the Any Value
dropdown opens the
[User Account Control Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/eventtype/window/useraccountcontrol.md)
with additional UAC flags to add to the filter.

## AD Objects Filter

Use the AD Objects filter to set the scope of the policy to only monitor specific objects in Active
