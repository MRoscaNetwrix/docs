# FSMO Role Monitoring Event Type

The FSMO Role Monitoring event type generates events based on policy rules when domain controllers
acquire or relinquish specified FSMO (Flexible Single Master Operation) roles.

The event filters for the FSMO Role Monitoring event type are:

- FSMO Operations
- FSMO Roles
- Domains/Servers
- AD Perpetrator
- Rule Preview

Each filter tab acts like an "AND" statement for the filter. Any filter tab left blank is treated
like an "ALL" for that filter set.

## FSMO Operations Filter

Use the FSMO Operations filter to capture events when a domain controller is assigned a FSMO role or
when a FSMO role is seized from a domain controller.

Select the **All** checkbox to generate events when a domain controller acquires or relinquishes a
FSMO role.

On selecting it, both the Acquire and Relinquish checkboxes are automatically checked.

- Check the **Acquire** checkbox to generate events when a domain controller acquires a FSMO role.
- Check the **Relinquish** checkbox to generate events when a domain controller relinquishes a FSMO
  role.

## FSMO Roles Filter

On the FSMO Roles filter, specific FSMO role assignments for a domain controller are selected to be
monitored.

security principals committing changes or to exclude specific security principals committing changes
from being monitored.

Sub Tree

When contexts are added, a Sub-Tree checkbox displays. Check it to apply the filter to the parent
and all child contexts. Uncheck it to apply the filter to the listed context only.

## Rule Preview Filter

The Rule Preview filter displays a summary of the selected filter options. This is primarily used
for troubleshooting.

![Event Type - Rule Preview filter](/img/versioned_docs/threatprevention_7.4/threatprevention/admin/policies/eventtype/rulepreview.webp)

The text displayed represents the rules created based on the policy’s selected filters. Each row is
a selected filter. Notice the Word Wrap checkox. If checked, a filter statement may cover multiple
rows so that all of it is visible.
