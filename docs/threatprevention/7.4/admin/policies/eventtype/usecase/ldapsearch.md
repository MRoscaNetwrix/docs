# LDAP Search Operations Use Case

Use the LDAP Search operation to search for and identify activity that does not conform to your
security configurations.

When you create a policy with the
[LDAP Monitoring Event Type](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/eventtype/ldapmonitoring.md)
or the
[LDAP Lockdown Event Type](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/eventtype/ldaplockdown.md),
the LDAP filter allows you to enable the LDAP Search option.

The Secure configurations and Search scope options filter the search based on a match to the
selected configurations and scope of the LDAP query.

Secure configurations

This setting determines if events should be captured for an LDAP operation based on the security
protocol used by that operation.

Select **All** to capture LDAP events that used any protocol.

You can also limit Threat Prevention to capture LDAP events only when one of the selected
protocol(s) are used.

- SSL
- StartTLS
- Signed
- Signed and Sealed
- None â€“ To capture events for an LDAP operation that did not use any of the secure protocols

Search scopes

Select the All checkbox to search all scopes, or select specific scoping levels:

- Base
- One level
- Subtree

Only LDAP queries using the selected security options and search scope levels will have events
reported by the Agent.
