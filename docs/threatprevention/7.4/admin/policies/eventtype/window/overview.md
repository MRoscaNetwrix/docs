# Selection Windows

Many event type filters have selections windows for populating filter values. It may be necessary to
select a specific Agent to populate values in the selection window. Some selection windows also
include an option to switch between a Browse Mode and a Search Mode for locating Active Directory
filter values.

## Select an Agent

On several Select… windows, you must select a server where the Agent has been deployed, as these
windows present live information provided by the Agent. If no Agent is found, the window does not
open.

solution related policies:

- Active Directory – Select any Agent on any domain controller within the domain of interest
