# Event Viewer Window

The Event Viewer window, accessible through the right-click menu on a data row or by double-clicking
on a data row, displays a pivot view of the data.

The Event Viewer window displays the details for one event at a time, and only includes those
columns visible within the data grid. The arrow buttons at the bottom of the window allow for
navigation through the events currently displayed in the data grid.
