# Exchange Changes Event Type

The Exchange Changes event type produces events for specified activities on the Exchange Server.

The event filters for the Exchange Changes event type are:

- Exchange Event

- Exchange Trustees
- Exchange Perpetrators
- Rule Preview

![Policy window - Exchange Changes Event Type](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/eventtype/exchangechanges.webp)

Each filter tab acts like an "AND" statement for the filter. Any filter tab left blank is treated
like an "ALL" for that filter set.

## Exchange Event Filter

the policy.

  [List of Collections Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/collectionmanager/listcollections.md)
  to the appropriate Collection category.

## Exchange Trustees Filter

Use the Exchange Trustees filter for monitoring to set the scope of the policy to only monitor
specific Exchange trustees. Trustees are the accounts receiving permissions. For example, if an
administrator grants Joe Smith access to Bob Wilson's mailbox, Joe Smith is the trustee that is
granted permissions.

Select the **Include** or **Exclude** button and then edit the list. Select the radio button for
either **Include** or **Exclude**.

The other option button options dictate how the Exchange Trustees filter and the Exchange
Perpetrators filter relate to each other. They include:

- Trustee OR Perpetrator Must Be Met – When either the Trustee selection OR the Perpetrator
  selection is met, the filter will be set to true

  - For an Include example, if this policy is monitoring a CEO mailbox, the Trustee list is set to
    includes Brad Wilson, and the Perpetrator list is set to include Administrator, then the
    policy will monitor when Brad Wilson is added as the mailbox trustee by anyone AND it will
    monitor anyone else added as the mailbox trustee by Administrator.
  - For an Exclude example, if this policy is monitoring a CEO mailbox, the Trustee list is set to
    exclude Brad Wilson, and the Perpetrator list is set to exclude Administrator, then the policy
    will not monitor when Brad Wilson is added as the mailbox trustee by anyone AND it will not
    monitor anyone else added as the mailbox trustee by Administrator.

- Trustee AND Perpetrator Must Be Met – Both the Trustee selection AND the Perpetrator selection
  must be met

  - For an Include example, if this policy is monitoring a CEO mailbox, the Trustee list is set to
    includes Brad Wilson, and the Perpetrator list is set to include Administrator, then the
    policy will monitor when Administrator adds Brad Wilson as the mailbox trustee.
  - For an Exclude example, if this policy is monitoring a CEO mailbox, the Trustee list is set to
    exclude Brad Wilson, and the Perpetrator list is set to exclude Administrator, then the policy
    will not monitor when Administrator adds Brad Wilson as the mailbox trustee.

specific security principals committing changes or to exclude specific security principals
committing changes from being monitored.

  - When the Include option button is selected for the Logged On As checkboxes and the Exclude
    option button is selected for the AND/OR options – If Administrator is Included for the Logged
    On As option and Joe Smith is Excluded in the Perpetrator list, then the filter will be true

## Rule Preview Filter

The Rule Preview filter displays a summary of the selected filter options. This is primarily used
for troubleshooting.

The text displayed represents the rules created based on the policy’s selected filters. Each row is
a selected filter. Notice the Word Wrap checkox. If checked, a filter statement may cover multiple
rows so that all of it is visible.
