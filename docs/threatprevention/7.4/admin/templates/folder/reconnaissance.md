| LDAP: LAPS Security & Active Directory LAPS Configuration Recon | Microsoft’s LAPS is a useful tool for automatically managing Windows computer local Administrator passwords. Since LAPS requires the computer attributes to be present, attackers can check to see if LAPS is “installed” in Active Directory by checking for the presence of the LAPS attributes in AD. This policy will identify attempts to query AD for attributes that associated with the presence of LAPS         | - NEW 5.1 TEMPLATES - LAPS - Reconnaissance                                                  |

| LDAP: Service Accounts Recon                                    | If intruders attack a service that uses a highly privileged System account, they might be able to conduct further exploits under that account's context. Many organizations use common cosmetic naming conventions to denote service accounts or maintain a list of service accounts. This policy can be configured to detect attempts to discover service accounts.                                                     | - NEW 5.1 TEMPLATES - LDAP - Reconnaissance - Service Accounts                               |
