# Actions Tab

The Actions tab is for configuring various responses, or event consumers, to the event data a policy
captures.

![Template – Actions tab](/img/versioned_docs/threatprevention_7.4/threatprevention/admin/policies/actions/actionstab.webp)

The following types of actions are available:

- Send to Events DB – Logs events to the event database for reporting, using the built-in database
  event consumer
- Send to SIEM – Sends formatted messages to a SIEM server as configured in a profile
- Send to Netwrix Threat Manager – Sends data for this policy to Netwrix Threat Manager, formerly
  StealthDEFEND
- Email Notifications – Sends formatted email notifications to the selected message profile
- Add Custom Scripts

  - File Actions – Records the events to a log (text) file in XML or Comma Delimited (CSV) format
  - .NET Script Actions – Runs a user‐supplied script that implements an automated action in
    response to the event. Scripts can be written in Visual Basic or C#
  - PowerShell 4.0 Actions – Runs a user-supplied PowerShell script that implements an automated
    action in response to the event

Multiple event consumers can be configured for a single policy, even multiple event consumers of the
same type. However, only one database event consumer can be added per policy.

Actions are configured to run on a separate thread from the policy’s event processing thread.
Incoming events have a dedicated thread/queue for processing. Email notification has a dedicated
thread/queue for processing. Custom Script actions has a dedicated thread/queue for processing. This
allows the action to process without blocking new events from going into the database while the
action completes.

You can enable or disable an action in any of the following ways:

- Check or uncheck the Enabled checkbox for an action in the Action Configurations list
- On selecting an action in the Action Configurations list, its details are displayed on the Actions
  tab. You can check or uncheck the Enabled checkbox for the action here.

Save all changes made to a policy or a template before leaving the configuration interface.

## Send to Events DB

This is the primary action and is enabled by default in new policies. It saves the event data a
policy monitors and captures to the NVMonitorData database. Typically this option is only unchecked
by Netwrix Support during a troubleshooting session or when the only desired output is a file for an
alert. Reporting uses the events database.

## Send to SIEM

This action is added by selecting the desired SIEM profile to be the recipient of the SIEM
notifications from the drop-down menu. Only SIEM profiles previously created are available for
selection. This action can also be assigned within the
[System Alerting Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/systemalerting/overview.md).

**NOTE:** To enable this feature, a Threat Prevention administrator must first establish a
connection with the SIEM server and configure the mapping file through the
[System Alerting Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/systemalerting/overview.md).

## Send to Netwrix Threat Manager

This action can be checked to send event data for the policy to Netwrix Threat Manager. This is
specific to integration with a full version deployment of Netwrix Threat Manager. The Netwrix Threat
Manager Reporting Module uses the NVMonitorData database (Send to Events DB option) for reporting
purposes.

**NOTE:** To enable this feature, the Web Request Action Module (Netwrix Threat Manager URI) must be
created and configured by a Threat Prevention administrator through the
[Event Sink Tab](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/threatmanagerconfiguration.md#event-sink-tab)
on the Netwrix Threat Manager Configuration window.

## Email Notifications

**CAUTION:** Email notifications should not be used on highly active policies. Please reserve this
feature for policies where immediate notification of an event is needed.

To enable email notifications, select the desired message profile to be recipient of the email
notifications from the drop-down menu. Only message profiles previously created are available for
selection. This action can also be assigned on the
[System Alerting Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/systemalerting/overview.md).

![Actions tab - Email Notifications section](/img/versioned_docs/threatprevention_7.4/threatprevention/admin/policies/actions/emailnotificationssetup.webp)

Enable the Email Notifications checkbox, select a message profile and then choose to enable the
**Prevent Repeat Emails by** option. If enabled:

- Select the radio button for either Policy or Subject:

  - Policy – Threat Prevention will send an email notification for the first event only, and skip
    notifications for any other events captured by the same policy during the duration you specify
    in the boxes below.
  - Subject – Threat Prevention will send an email notification (say, Notification1) for the first
    event only, and skip notifications for any other events whose email notification will have the
    same subject line as Notification1. It will skip sending notifications for the duration you
    specify in the boxes below. Note that the subject line is configured within the message
    profile.

- Set the duration (in minutes or hours) for which emails notifications are skipped after an email
  is sent for a policy/subject line.

Example:

In the following example, let’s assume you have the following settings for Prevent Repeat Emails by:

- Option selected: Policy
- Duration set: 5 minutes

In a situation where Threat Prevention captures 15 events in 5 minutes against a policy, an email
notification will be sent in real time for the first event only. The remaining events will be logged
in the application but email notifications will not be generated.

Two hours later, when another event is captured against that same policy, Threat Prevention will
send an email notification for it. If more events are captured within the next five minutes, email
notifications will not be generated.

**NOTE:** To enable email notifications, the SMTP gateway must first be configured and message
profiles created by a Threat Prevention  administrator, which is done through the
[System Alerting Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/systemalerting/overview.md).

## Custom Scripts

In the Actions Configurations area at the top of the tab, assigned File, .NET Script, or PowerShell
4.0 actions are listed with their name, type, description, and whether they are enabled or disabled.

- Click **Add** (+) to open the Add Action window. Choose the type of action and configure the
  script.
- Use the Remove (x) button to delete a custom script action from a policy.

See the following topics for additional information:

- [File Actions](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/actions/file.md)
- [.NET Script Actions](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/actions/netscript.md)

  - Optionally, custom scripts can be provided through a Netwrix Statement of Work.

- [PowerShell 4.0 Actions](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/policies/actions/powershell.md)

  - Optionally, custom scripts can be provided through a Netwrix Statement of Work.

**NOTE:** There are custom scripts created by Netwrix Engineers that execute the notification
emails. See the
[Custom Scripts](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/templates/folder/actions.md#custom-scripts)
topic for additional information.
