# Tags Node

Tags can be added to templates as an organizational tool. Tags are displaed as folders under the
TAGS node. Several preconfigured templates include tags, which are displayed after those templates
have been imported into the Administration Console. A template can have multiple tags added, and the
template is displayed in the folder for each tag. If a new tag is added, Refresh the TAGS node to
view its folder.

Adding tags to a template does not create a duplicate template, but rather multiple places to access
the template from. A modification made to a template within a folder under the TAGS node is a
modification to that template no matter where it is accessed after that, i.e. from under the
Templates node or from another folder under the TAGS node.
