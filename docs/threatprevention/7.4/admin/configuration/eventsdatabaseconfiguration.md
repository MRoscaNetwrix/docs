The Event database is originally configured when installing the Threat Prevention Enterprise Manager
package. See the
[Application Server Install](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/install/application.md)
topic for additional information. This window displays the current connection settings for the Event
database.

Credentials and/or SQL Server host information can be changed in the DB Connection Manager
application. See the
[DB Connection Manager Wizard](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/install/dbconnectionmanager.md)
topic for additional information.
