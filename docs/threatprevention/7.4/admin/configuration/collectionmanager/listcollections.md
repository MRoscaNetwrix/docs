- The _I want a list to come from the database table_ option button enables a dynamic collection.
  Enter the table name in the textbox that appears or select it from the drop-down menu. See the
  [Dynamic Collections](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/collectionmanager/dynamic.md)
  topic for additional information.

**Step 3 –** Provide a unique, descriptive name for the collection in the name box.

**Step 5 –** The Created By, Created On, Modified By, and Modified On boxes are automatically
populated when collections are created or changed.

Some collection can be configured to be dynamic collections. See the
[Dynamic Collections](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/collectionmanager/dynamic.md)
topic for additional information. The Perpetrators and Lockdown Perpetrators collections also have
the option to expand group membership. See the
[Expand Groups Option for Perpetrators & Objects Collection](#expand-groups-option-for-perpetrators--objects-collection)
topic for additional information.

**Step 7 –** When the configuration is set as desired, click **OK** to save the collection.

## Expand Groups Option for Perpetrators & Objects Collection

The Expand Groups option on the Add New Collection window is only available for the following
collections:

- Perpetrators
- Lockdown Perpetrators
- Objects
- Lockdown Objects

![Expand Groups option on the Add New Collection window](/img/product_docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/configuration/collectionmanager/expandgroups.webp)

- For Perpetrators – If checked, the groups and nested-groups are expanded to monitor effective
  group membership at the user level. This means the Agent monitors/blocks based on the user’s token
  instead of the group’s token. The impact specifically for Lockdown Perpetrators collections is
  that this option allows for the immediate blocking of a currently logged in user who has had a
  group membership change while logged in.
- For Objects – If checked, when a group object is added, then the groups and nested-groups are
  expanded to monitor effective group membership at the user level. This means the Agent
  monitors/blocks based on the user’s token instead of the group’s token. The impact specifically
  for Lockdown Objects collections is that this option allows for the immediate blocking of a
  currently logged in user who has had a group membership change while logged in.

The Expand Groups option does NOT apply to other object types.

There is a maximum cap of 1000 users/objects that can be expanded. If the total number of users or
objects of the groups added to a single collection exceeds 1000, then the Agent defaults to
monitoring/blocking based on the groups’ tokens.

If group membership cannot be resolved, then the Agent defaults to monitoring/blocking based on the
groups’ tokens.

Collection window opens.
