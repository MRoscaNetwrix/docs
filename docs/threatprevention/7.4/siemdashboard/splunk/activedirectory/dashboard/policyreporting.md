# Policy Reporting Dashboard

The Policy Reporting dashboard is for viewing Threat Prevention events from any enabled policy that
is sending events to Splunk. The Policy drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the dashboard
will be populated with all the enabled Threat Prevention policies sending event data to Splunk in
alphanumeric order. On selecting a policy, the dashboard cards will load the event data from that
policy.

The Policy Reporting dashboard contains the following cards:
