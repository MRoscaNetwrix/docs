# Select Computers Window

The Deploy Agents wizard's Select Computer window is the first in a sequence of four windows to
deploy the Agent on a computer. It provides three methods for selecting computers where Agent(s) can
be deployed:

- Add Single Host
- Add from AD
- Add from File

Any combination of these three methods can be used to select computers.

## Add Single Host Tab

The Add Single Host tab is displayed by default when the Select Computer window opens.

Manually enter and select the host name or IP address of a computer. Use the double-arrow button to
add it to the Deploy Agents to These Computers box.

## Add From AD Tab

Click the Add From AD tab.

want to deploy the Agent.

  the desired domain in the textbox. Click Connect to connect to the domain.

Click the Add From File tab.

You can import a text file with a list of computer names or IP addresses with carriage returns, or a
CSV file with comma-separated values.

- Text File to Read – Click Open to browse and select the required file. The box displays the path
  to the file.
- List of Hosts/IP Addresses – Populates with computers from the text/CSV file
- Add (>>) button – Adds the selected computer(s) to the Deploy Agents to These Computers box

Once the list in the Deploy Agents to These Computers box is complete, you can continue through the
wizard to deploy the Agent. See the
[Set Options Window ](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/threatprevention/admin/agents/deploy/setoptions.md)topic
for the next step.
