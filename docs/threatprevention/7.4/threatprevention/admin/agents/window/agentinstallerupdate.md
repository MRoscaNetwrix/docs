# Agent Installer Update Window

Netwrix periodically releases updated Agent installation packages. Typically these updates are
associated with Microsoft KBs (hot-fixes) which alter the LSASS components interfering with the
Agent instrumentation. See the
[Agent Information](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/threatprevention/install/agent/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

To download an installation package, the Threat Prevention server must be connected to the internet.
It may be necessary to allow the following URL in the browser security settings:

- For Threat Prevention v7.4:

**Step 2 –** Click **Check for Newer Version of the Netwrix Threat Prevention Agent**. Threat
Prevention downloads the Agent installer from a static URL and then compares the Agent installer
currently in use to the installer downloaded.

  displays the Agent version number. Click **Close** to close the window.

- If the downloaded version is newer, the message displays both version numbers and provides an
  option to apply the update. Click **Apply Update**.

**NOTE:** When the Agent installer is replaced with a newer version, all Agents’ versions in the
Agents interface are highlighted to indicate they are not the current version. Agents should then be
updated to the new version, using the Upgrade Agent option on the right-click menu.
