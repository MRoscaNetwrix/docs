For NAS monitoring, the selected Agent needs to be deployed to a Windows server acting as a proxy
server for NAS activity. If the correct Agent is selected, the IP address(es) of the NAS device(s)
are displayed in the Navigation pane. Type the path(s), one per row in the Results pane. Click
**OK** and the NAS paths are added to the list of paths to be monitored.

The paths entered can be file or folder names.

- For example, type c:\HR\NewHireProcess.doc for a NAS device with 192.168.16.188 as IP address, and
  it appears in the paths list as c:\HR\NewHireProcess.doc (\192.168.16.188).
