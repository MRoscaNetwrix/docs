# Threat Prevention 7.4

> Proactive security firewall for critical IT infrastructure

Threat Prevention 7.4 acts as an intelligent firewall around your most critical systems including Active Directory, Exchange, and file systems. This solution intercepts and blocks malicious activities in real-time, overcoming the limitations of native Windows security controls to provide comprehensive protection against both internal and external threats while maintaining detailed audit trails for compliance and forensics.

## Key Features

- **Active Threat Interception**: Monitor and block suspicious activities at the source before damage occurs
- **Automated Remediation**: Instantly disable compromised accounts and reverse unauthorized changes
- **Policy-Based Protection**: Define granular security policies for different systems and user groups
- **Comprehensive Forensics**: Capture detailed audit trails of all activities for investigation

## Benefits

- **Stop Attacks in Progress**: Block malicious activities in real-time, not after the fact
- **Protect Critical Assets**: Safeguard Active Directory, Exchange, and file systems from compromise
- **Reduce Security Incidents**: Prevent attacks rather than just detecting them
- **Simplify Compliance**: Maintain detailed audit trails for regulatory requirements

## What's New in Version 7.4

- Enhanced machine learning algorithms for threat detection
- Improved SIEM integration with QRadar and Splunk
- New policy templates for common attack scenarios
- Performance optimizations for large-scale deployments
