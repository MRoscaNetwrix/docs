# Upgrade Policy Templates

When new or updated policy templates are available with a Threat Prevention upgrade, they are not
automatically imported when you install the latest version. The Import feature can be used to update
templates and import new templates.

the
[Upgrade Procedure](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/install/upgrade/overview.md)

**Step 3 –** To import all new templates, select the **SI_Template_All** XML file. Click **Open**.

**Step 4 –** The Import window displays information for the template(s). Click **Import**.

**Step 5 –** An Import Decision window opens when a duplicate collection or template is found.
