desktop, which opens the Netwrix Threat Manager Reporting Module console:

**Step 1 –** Double-click the **Netwrix Threat Manager Dashboard** icon to open the console for the
first time.

There is a built-in ADMIN account used for the initial configuration steps and granting user access.
The User Name is "admin". You will set the password and optionally enable MFA for this account
during first launch. Follow the steps to setup this account.

**Step 2 –** Specify a password in the **New Password** and **Confirm Password** fields. It must
meet the following minimum requirements:

- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (symbol)
- Have a minimum length of 10 characters

**Step 3 –** By default, MFA is enabled. Toggle this option off or on as desired. If the Enable MFA
option is set to ON, the application will provide an internally-generated one-time password (OTP)
option for the Administrator account. If the Enable MFA option is set to OFF, only a username and
password will be required to sign in.

**Step 4 –** Click Set Password.

The built-in ADMIN account password is now set.

If the Enable MFA option is set to OFF, no additional configuration is required and the Netwrix
Threat Manager Reporting Module Console opens. See the
[Set Up the Threat Manager Reporting Module](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/gettingstarted.md#set-up-the-threat-manager-reporting-module)
topic for initial configuration information.

If the Enable MFA option is set to ON, registration of an MFA authenticator is required. Proceed to
the Configure MFA for the Bultin Administrator Account topic.

## Configure MFA for the Bultin Administrator Account

If MFA was enabled for the buildtin Administrator account during first launch, follow the steps to
configure MFA for the account.

**Step 1 –** Register the MFA authenticator. The Register Authenticator prompt will provide
instructions to configure multi-factor authentication with an external or third-party application.

**Step 2 –** On successful registration with an authenticator, enter the verification code and click
Continue.

**Step 3 –** A list of recovery codes will be presented in order to restore access to the
application in the event of lost access to the authenticator application or device. Save this list
of codes to access for account recovery, if needed.

**Step 4 –** Click **Continue**.

Once MFA is configured for this account, the Netwrix Threat Manager Reporting Module console opens.
See the
[Set Up the Threat Manager Reporting Module](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/gettingstarted.md#set-up-the-threat-manager-reporting-module)
topic for the next steps.
