# Manual Agent Deployment

The Threat PreventionAgent must be installed to the appropriate systems for monitoring. See the
[Agent Information](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/install/agent/overview.md)
topic for specifics on where to deploy.

The Threat Prevention Agent can be deployed through any of the following methods:

- Deploy the Agent to server(s) through the Administration Console – You can deploy the Agent to one
  or multiple servers through the Administration Console

  :::info
  This is the recommended method for deploying the Agent.
  :::


- Manually through the Windows Agent Setup Wizard – Run the Agent executable to launch this wizard

See the
[Agents Interface](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/agents/overview.md)
topic and the
[Deploy Agents](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/agents/deploy/overview.md)
topic for additional information to deploy the Agent through the Administration Console.

Follow the steps to manually deploy the Agent.

:::note
Manually deploying the Agent requires an Enrollment Secret, which is a limited-life (1
hour) password generated by the Enterprise Manager. The Agent Installer uses it to ensure that the
Agent is connected to a legitimate Enterprise Manager. Prior to launching the Threat Prevention
Windows Agent Setup wizard, note the values for the enrollment secret and the EM certificate. See
the
[Enrollment Secret Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/agents/agentswindows/enrollmentsecretconfiguration.md)
topic for additional information.
:::


**Step 1 –** From the Threat Prevention server, copy the Agent executable (
`...\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager\Setup\SI Agent.exe`) to the machine where
you want to install the Agent. Then run the executable. The Netwrix Threat Prevention Windows Agent
Setup wizard opens.

![Threat Prevention Windows Agent Setup wizard - CA Certificate Configuration page](/images/threatprevention/7.4/install/agent/cacertconfig.webp)

**Step 6 –** On the CA Certificate Configuration page, select one of the following options for the
certificate and click **Next**:

- Managed by Netwrix Threat Prevention – To use certificates that are signed and managed by Threat
  Prevention
- Custom-managed – To use certificates that are signed by the customer's external certificate
  authority

![Threat Prevention Windows Agent Setup wizard - Enterprise Manager Location Information page](/images/threatprevention/7.4/install/agent/enterprisemanager.webp)

**Step 7 –** On the Enterprise Manager Location Information page, select the **Option** button for a
product to enable communication with it.

- Enterprise Manager host or IP address – For Threat Prevention
- SAM configuration file – For Activity Monitor

- In the **Address or Path** box, enter the following:

  - For Threat Prevention – Enter the host name or IP address of the machine where the Enterprise
    Manager service is located
  - For Activity Monitor – Enter the path to the activity agent configuration file for this host.

    :::tip
        Remember, the Activity Monitor activity agent must already be deployed on the domain
    controller and enabled before installing the AD agent. The default path is:
    `…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIWindowsAgent\SAMConfig.xml`
    :::


  :::note
  As a prerequisite for using custom managed certificates, you must provide the
  Enterprise Manager server DNS name, hostname, or FQDN (instead of the IP address) when
  installing Threat Prevention server, remote instance of the Administration Console, and the
  Agent. See the
  [Administration Console and Agent Not Communicating with the Enterprise Manager ](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/troubleshooting/enterprisemanagercommunication.md)topics
  for additional information.
  :::


- The default Enterprise Manager port is 3741. Modify if necessary. The port configuration only
  applies to the Enterprise Manager Host option.

  :::note
  On selecting the **Enterprise Manger host or IP address** option button and providing
  valid information for the Enterprise Manager in the **Address or Path** and **Port** boxes, the
  Agent automatically connects to the Enterprise Manager.
  :::


- Configure additional Agent options as desired:

  - Safe Mode – This option prevents the **Windows AD Events** monitoring module from loading if
    the LSASS DLL versions has been modified since the last time the Threat Prevention Windows
    Agent service was started.
  - Start Agent Service – This option starts the Threat Prevention Windows Agent service after the
    Agent is installed. If the Threat Prevention Windows Agent service is not started during
    installation, the Agent requires a manual start or needs to be started automatically after a
    server reboot. Until the Agent is started, no activity monitoring or blocking occurs.

    :::note
    If **Custom-managed** is selected on the CA Certificate Configuration page, the
    **Start Agent Service** checkbox is disabled because Agent installer does not obtain a
    signed certificate from Enterprise Manager in the custom-managed mode. After installing the
    Agent, you must create and provide certificates signed by your certificate authority.
    :::


  - Create Windows Firewall Rules – This option creates the rules needed to open this port during
    the installation process. If using a third party firewall, uncheck this option and manually
    create the necessary firewall rules.

When the settings are configured, click **Next**.

![StealthINTERCEPT Windows Agent Setup wizard on the Certificates page](/images/threatprevention/7.4/install/agent/certificates.webp)

**Step 8 –** On the Certificates page, confirm the EM certificate hash by verifying that it contains
the same value displayed in the
[Enrollment Secret Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/agents/agentswindows/enrollmentsecretconfiguration.md)
in the Administration Console.

:::note
This page is not displayed when "Custom-managed" is selected on the CA Certificate
Configuration wizard page .It is also not displayed when the Agent is reinstalled on a machine and
the Certsinfo folder was not manually deleted, in which case the original certificates are re-used.
The Certsinfo folder is located at: …\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIWindowsAgent\CertsInfo\
:::


- Approve certificates – Select this checkbox to approve the thumbprint, which will then enable the
  Enrollment Secret box. Enter the enrollment secret obtained from the
  [Enrollment Secret Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/admin/agents/agentswindows/enrollmentsecretconfiguration.md).

  :::note
  If the enrollment secret has expired, you can generate a new one.
  :::


![Threat Prevention Windows Agent Setup wizard - Select Event Sources page](/images/threatprevention/7.4/install/agent/eventsources.webp)

**Step 9 –** On the Select Event Sources page, select the types of events to be monitored by this
Agent. The installer grays out options that are not applicable to the server where the Agent is
being deployed. Click **Next**.

- Windows Event Logs – Available for legacy versions. Option should be grayed-out.
- Windows File System – Available as part of the Threat Prevention for File System and the Threat
  Prevention for Active Directory solutions.
  - Check this option if the system on which the Agent is being installed will be used for
    monitoring the local Windows file system
  - Check this option if the system on which the Agent is being installed is a domain controller
    where Group Policy Object monitoring or blocking will be conducted
- Windows Active Directory Events – Available as part of the Threat Prevention for Active Directory
  and the Threat Prevention for Exchange solutions. Also available as part of the Activity Monitor
  for Active Directory solution.
  - Select this component if the system the Agent is being installed on is an Active Directory
    domain controller. This option is grayed-out if the target system is not a domain controller.
- Exchange Server Monitoring – Available as part of the Threat Prevention for Exchange solution.
  - Select this component if the system where the Agent is being installed is running the Exchange
    Server. This option will be grayed-out if this Agent is not being installed on an Exchange
    Server.
