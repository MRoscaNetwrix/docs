# MSP System

To ensure optimal operation, we recommend that the following hardware resources are made available:

## Microsoft SQL Server

The following system requirements are the minimum system requirements and should manage around 10 customers with less than 20 users each.

* Windows Server 2016 (or newer)
* MSSQL Server 2014 (or newer)
* 4 CPU’s
* 16 GB RAM
* min. 100 GB HDD

**CAUTION:** Please note, that using a SQL Server with Express edition is not recommended because of diverse limitations there.

If your customer's count is growing over time, you should add every 200 users a minimum of at least:

* 2 CPU’s
* 8 GB RAM

## Application Server

The following system requirements are the minimum system requirements and should manage around 10 customers with 20 users each.

* Windows Server 2016 (or newer)
* 4 CPU’s
* 16 GB RAM
* min. 50 GB HDD
* .NET Framework 4.8

If your customer's count is growing over time, you should add every 200 users a minimum of at least:

* 1 CPU
* 4 GB RAM

RECOMMENDED: Currently, we suggest you use an application server to handle a max of about 100 customers. So if you reach 100 customers, you should set up a second Application Server or use some sort of load balancing between the application servers.

**CAUTION:** Every additional 1000 users an additional Web-Endpoint - incl. loadbalancing - is recommended

**CAUTION:** Every additional 100 customers/1000 users an additional Application Server - incl. loadbalancing - is recommended.

NOTE: Please note that individual variables - like the number of passwords per user - will affect performance. Especially for MSP-Systems it is required to monitor performance continuously, and add additional resources on demand.
