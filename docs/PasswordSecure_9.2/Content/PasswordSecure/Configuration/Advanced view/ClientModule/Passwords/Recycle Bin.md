# Recycle Bin

This option allows you to view and permanently delete deleted passwords to which you are entitled.

## Procedure for deleting passwords

To put passwords into the recycle bin there are 2 possible procedures. Select the passwords you want to delete and click on **Move to bin (1)** or right-click on the passwords and select **Move to bin(2)**.
