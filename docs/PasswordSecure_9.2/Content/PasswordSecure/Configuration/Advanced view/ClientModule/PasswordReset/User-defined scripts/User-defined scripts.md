# User-defined scripts

## Individual solutions using your own scripts

If your requirements cannot be met using the [Scripts](../Scripts/Scripts "Scripts"), it is also possible to create your own Powershell scripts. These scripts need to meet certain requirements to be used in Netwrix Password Secure.

## Storage location, name and call

The scripts must be saved in the following directory:
`C:\ProgramData\MATESO\Password Safe and Repository Service\System\PowerShell`

The scripts are saved in the **format.ps1**.

## Structure of the scripts

The PowerShell scripts must have the following structure:

### RunScript function

Netwrix Password Secure always calls the RunScript function.

[Copy](javascript:void(0);)

```
function RunScript  
param (  
        [String]$HostName,  
        [String]$UserName,  
        [String]$NewPassword,  
        [String]$CredentialsUserName,  
        [Security.SecureString]$CredentialsPassword  
    )  

```
The following standard parameters can be used here:

* UserName: The user name for which the password should be changed
* Password: The password that should be reset
* CredentialsUserName: The user name of the user authorized to carry our the reset (e.g. administrator)
* CredentialsPassword: The password of the authorized user

### Scriptblock

The **scriptblock** can be used when the script should run in the context of another user. The actual change is then carried out in the **scriptblock**.

It is important in this case that you provide Netwrix Password Secure with feedback about what has been changed via a **Write-Output**. The following example simply uses the outputs **true** or **false**. However, it is also conceivable that an error message or similar is output.

[Copy](javascript:void(0);)

```
$scriptBlock = {param ($UserName, $Password)  
    // Make changes to SAP  
    if($OK) {  
        Write-Output "true"  
    } else {  
        Write-Output "false"  
    }  

```
Naturally, CredentialsUserName and CredentialsPassword can also be directly used in the script (i.e. without the **scriptblock**). You can view the supplied MSSQL script as an example.

### Invoke

A credential then still needs to be created. This is then transferred to the **scriptblock** using the **invoke** command. It is also important in this case to provide Netwrix Password Secure with feedback about all errors via **Write-Output** or **throw [System.Exception]**.
