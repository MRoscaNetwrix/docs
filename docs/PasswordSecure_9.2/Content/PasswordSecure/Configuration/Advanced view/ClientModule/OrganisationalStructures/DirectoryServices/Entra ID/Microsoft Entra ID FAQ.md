# Microsoft Entra ID Services FAQ

## Is it possible to migrate from LDAP to Entra ID?

Currently, an automated migration from LDAP users (E2E as well as MasterKey) to Entra ID users is not possible!

## Which port is used for the SCIM endpoint for provisioning users/groups from Entra ID to the Application Server?

11015 is the port that will be used for the communication from Entra ID to Netwrix Password Secure.

## Does the Entra ID connection support nested groups?

Due to Azure based technical limitations, Netwrix Password Secure does not support nested groups.

## Does Entra ID work on servers that are only available internally?

An integration on servers, that are not accessible from external sources, the integration of Entra ID is also possible. For this, you can use the [Entra ID on-premises application provisioning to SCIM-enabled apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/on-premises-scim-provisioning "Azure AD on-premises application provisioning to SCIM-enabled apps"). This can be installed on all or only one application server. It must be noted that the IP or DNS name of the "Tenent URL" specified in the subsequently created enterprise application is present in the alternative application names in the server certificate.
Tip: `https://127.0.0.1:11015/scim` can also be specified as the "Tenent URL", in which case 127.0.0.1 must again be present in the alternative application names in the server certificate.
