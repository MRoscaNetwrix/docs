# Yubico / Yubikey

## Setting up multifactor authentication

### Requirements

The following firewall release must be granted:

* 

### Requesting the Yubico API key

An API key must be requested for configuration. For this purpose, use the following link and enter an e-mail address: [Yubico Website](https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/)

![yubico setup](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_1-en.png "yubico setup")

Yubikey will then generate a **One Time Password**. The Yubikey used must only be touched in the right place.

![yubico stick](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_2-en.png "yubico stick")

The **One Time Password** is entered directly into the corresponding field.

![yubico OTP](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_3-en.png "yubico OTP")

Once the general terms and conditions have been approved, the API Key can be requested.

### Configuring the Yubikey API

The actual setting up of the multifactor authentication is carried out on the Server Manager in the **Database** module. First select the required data base; then open the "Features" in the ribbon.
The **Yubico Client ID** and the **Yubico Secret Key** must then be entered and saved.

![Configuration yubico](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_5-en.png "Configuration yubico")

The interface is now ready and can be used.

NOTE: The HTTPS endpoint [Yubico Verify](https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify) is used for communication with Yubico. Please make sure that the Netwrix Password Secure Server can connect to this endpoint.

## Configuring multifactor authentication for users

Multifactor authentication can be configured in the Netwrix Password Secure client. It can be done by the user themselves in **Backstage** in the [Account](../../../../MainMenu/Account/Account "Account") menu. In order to configure the Yubikey, simply select **Yubico OTP**.

![setup second factor](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_6-en.png "setup second factor")

Now click in the field for the token and create a token using the Yubikey. For **Yubikey NEO**, you only need to touch the touch panel. The same applies to **Yubikey Nano**.

![yubico stick](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_2-en.png "yubico stick")

The token is entered directly into the corresponding field. The multifactor authentication is configured once youâ€™ve clicked on configure.

![Configuration yubico](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_8-en.png "Configuration yubico")

## Logging in with the Yubikey

To login with Multifactor Authentication, the database is first selected and then **User Name** and **Password** are entered and confirmed.

After the first password authentication, another window for the **Yubico Key** is displayed.

![Login yubico](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_10-en.png "Login yubico")

Click on the field to highlight it, and enter the **Yubico Key** by touching the Yubikeys.

![yubico stick](../../../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/yubico_yubikey_2-en.png "yubico stick")

The user is now logged on.
