# Changes in the Server Manager

#### Navigation

In the previous on-prem version, there are the modules Databases (1) and Backups (2).

![Modules in AdminClient](../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/Module-AC-en_606x403.png "Modules in AdminClient")

In the new MSP version these have been replaced by the modules Customers (1) and Cost Overview (2).

![AdminClient - MSP module](../../../../../../../../static/images/PasswordSecure_9.2/Content/Resources/Images/Module-MSP-AC-en.png "AdminClient - MSP module")

In the MSP version, you will find the individual customer databases under the Customers module.

NOTE: The Backup module has been removed, because Netwrix Password Secure's own backup is not suitable for environments with multiple customer databases. As a Managed Service Provider, you must back up your customer databases yourself using appropriate measures.

The Status and Web Application modules are identical in both versions.
