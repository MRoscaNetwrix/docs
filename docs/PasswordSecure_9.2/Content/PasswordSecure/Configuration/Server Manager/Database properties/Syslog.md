# Syslog

If desired, the server logs and also the **[Logbook](../../Advanced view/ClientModule/Logbook/Logbook "Logbook")** can be transferred to a Syslog server. Double clicking on a database allows you to access its settings. The corresponding menu items can be found there.

After activating the Syslog interface via the corresponding option, it is possible to configure the Syslog server. If desired, the entire logbook can also be transferred via another option.
