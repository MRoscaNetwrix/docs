# Server Manager

## What is the Server Manager?

The Server Manager takes care of the central administration of the databases as well as the configuration of the backup profiles. In addition, it provides the very important interface to the Netwrix Password Secure license server. Furthermore, it is used for the administration of globally defined settings, as well as the configuration of profiles for sending emails.

In this sense, the server service represents the interface between the client and the SQL server. The Server Manager is responsible for configuring the server service. It allows the central administration of the databases without having access to the SQL server. This is a huge advantage with regards to organization and authorizations.
