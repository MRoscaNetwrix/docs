# Setup

## Requirements

Netwrix Password Secure Mobile Apps automatically synchronize with an existing Netwrix Password Secure database. The [Web Application](../../Web Applicaiton/Web Application "WebClient") is used as the interface for this. This must therefore be installed. In addition, the database must be enabled for use with mobile devices on the [Server Manager](../../Server Manager/Server Manger "AdminClient").

#### Setup and configuration

The setup and initial configuration of the **Netwrix Password Secure App** is explained in the following chapters:

* [Installation of the App / Requirements](Installation app/Installation of the App "Installation of the App / Requirements")
* [Linking the database](Linking database/Linking the database "Linking the database")
* [Biometric login](Biometric login/Biometric login "Biometric login")
* [Setting up autofill](Setting up autofill/Setting up autofill "Setting up autofill")
