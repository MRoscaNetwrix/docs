# Ownership Job Group

The Ownership job group is comprised of analysis and reports that focus on public folder ownership,
and most importantly the identification of each public folder's Most Probable Owner. The Most
Probable Owner is a unique algorithm built into the public folder data collector that is determined
based on folder ownership, content posted, and size of content posted.
