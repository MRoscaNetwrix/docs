# Report Configuration Wizard

You can use the Report Configuration Wizard to configure reports. The wizard can be launched for an existing report or when creating a new report. See the [Creating a Report](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/create.md) and [Editing Existing Reports](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/edit.md) topics for additional information.
