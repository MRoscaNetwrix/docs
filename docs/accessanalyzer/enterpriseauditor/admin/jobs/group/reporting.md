# Reporting Node

At the job group level, the __Reporting__ node identifies the report publishing and email configurations assigned for the job group. By default, all job groups are set to inherit the reporting settings, the __Use default setting__ option, from the global level (__Settings__ > __Reporting__), or a parent job group. See the [Reporting](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/reporting.md) topic for additional information.

__NOTE:__ If the Role Based Access feature is enabled, it also displays a list of all accounts granted access to the published reports via the Web Console that are generated by any jobs within the job group.

Checking the __Set all the child objects to inherit these settings__ option at the bottom of the page forces inheritance of these settings to all sub-groups and jobs within the job group. When enabled, this option overrides any custom settings configured for the child objects.

__NOTE:__ The __Set all the child objects to inherit these settings__ option has no impact on the inheritance of Report Roles.
