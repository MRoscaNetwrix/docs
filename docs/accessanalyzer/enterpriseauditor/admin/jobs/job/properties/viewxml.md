This opens the jobâ€™s XML file, which contains all of the job, query, and reporting configurations. When the log level is directly set at job level, the job XML ```<JOBLOGLEVEL>``` parameter will show a value of:

- 0 for Debug
- 1 for Info
- 2 for Warning
- 3 for Error

__NOTE:__ Job analysis configurations are kept in a separate XML file.
