# Storage Tab

The Storage tab is for configuring the Storage Profile. Choose either to use the default settings, which could be either the global configuration or configuration set via broken inheritance at a job group level, or to configure settings just for this job.

By default, all jobs are set to inherit the storage setting, the __Use Default__ option. To configure a different profile for the job, select the __Use This Profile__ option and select the desired Storage Profile from the drop-down menu. Storage Profiles can only be configured at the __Settings__ > __Storage__ node. See the [Storage](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/storage/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Click __OK__ to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click __Cancel__ if no changes were made.
