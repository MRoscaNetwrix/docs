# Notification Tab

The Notification tab is where email notifications are configured at the job level. Choose either to inherit the global configuration or to configure settings just for this job.

Deselect the __Use Global Settings__ option to configure custom settings for the job. Then provide a specific list of recipients for email notifications generated by this job. Multiple email addresses can be input by adding a semicolon (;) and space between entries. This is specific to Notification analysis module tasks.

Click __OK__ to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click __Cancel__ if no changes were made.
