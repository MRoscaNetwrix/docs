In the Navigation pane, select the query-created host list to edit and click __Edit Query__. The Host Discovery Wizard opens to the Query page where the query settings for the selected query-created host list are modified. See the [Host Discovery Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/hostdiscovery/wizard/overview.md) topic for information on modifying these settings.
