- [Results Pane](resultspane.md) – Displays various interfaces based on what is selected in the Navigation Pane or Activities Pane
- [Activities Pane](activitiespane.md) – Displays a list of activities which can be conducted within the currently selected console section

Access Analyzer Data Grids also have specific navigation options that enable users to filter, group, and search through data. See the [Data Grid Functionality](datagrid.md) topic for additional information.
