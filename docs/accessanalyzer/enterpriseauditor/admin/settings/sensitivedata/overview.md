# Sensitive Data

The Sensitive Data node provides configuration options to manage sensitive data criteria and false positive exclusion filters. These settings require Sensitive Data Discovery to be licensed. See the [Sensitive Data Discovery](../../../sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md) topic for additional information.

__NOTE:__ Sensitive data exclusion filters can only be applied to the [File System Solution](../../../solutions/filesystem/overview.md) and the [SharePoint Solution](../../../solutions/sharepoint/overview.md).
