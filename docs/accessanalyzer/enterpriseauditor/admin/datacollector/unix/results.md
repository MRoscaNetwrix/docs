The configurable options are:

- ROWKEY's components – Select the desired columns

Click __Finish__ to save the configuration changes, or __Back__ to return to the previous page. If no changes were made, it is a best practice to click __Cancel__ to close the Unix Data Collector Wizard to make sure that no accidental settings are saved.
