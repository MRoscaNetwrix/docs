# ExchangeMailbox:Â Properties

The Properties page is where properties that will be gathered are selected. The available properties depend on the category selected. It is a wizard page for all of the categories.

Properties can be selected individually or you can use the Select All, Clear All, and Reset All buttons. All selected properties will be gathered. Click __Message Classes__ to open the Message classes filters window.

The wildcard (```*```) returns all message class filters. Enter the name of the class filter and click __Add__ to add it to the list. __Delete__ will remove the selected class filter from the list. The __Load defaults__ option will restore the class filter default settings.
