# GroupPolicy:Â Policies List

The Policies List page is where the policies from the desired GPOs to be queried are selected. It is a wizard page for the categories of:

- Policies State
- Policies State for all GPOs
- Local Policies

Select the policies or policy parts to be audited. The category dictates how this selection is applied across the domain or local host.

To search parts of a policy, drill into the policy and select the desired policy parts. Click __Check all__ to select all properties, and click __Uncheck all__ to deselect all properties. Search for a policy by entering a policy name in the Search box and clicking __Search__.

__NOTE:__ The policy parts returned may have multiple values.

At least one policy or policy part must be selected in order to proceed to the next wizard page.
