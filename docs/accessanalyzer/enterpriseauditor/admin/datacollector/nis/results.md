# NIS:Â Results

The Results page is where properties from Unix to be gathered are selected. It is a wizard page for both categories.

Available properties have checkboxes that can be selected individually, or you can use the __Select All__, __Clear All__, and __Reset to defaults__ buttons. All selected properties are gathered. Available properties vary based on the category selected.

This information is not available within the standard reference tables and views. Instead, this information can be viewed in the ```SA_[Job Name]_DEFAULT``` table, which is created when any of these properties are selected.
