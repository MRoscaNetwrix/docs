# NIS:Â SID Mappings

The SID Mappings page is where the Windows-style SID mappings for the Unix User ID and Group ID are specified. It is a wizard page for the category of:

- Scan NIS User and Groups

![NIS Data Collector Wizard SID Mappings page](../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/datacollector/nis/sidmappings.webp)

The default settings work for most environments. Use this page to __Add__, __Edit__, or __Remove__ ID Mappings. Multiple entries are allowed. For each range of User ID or Group ID entered, the offset is added to the ID and the resulting SID is the format with ```%d``` replaced by the ID.
