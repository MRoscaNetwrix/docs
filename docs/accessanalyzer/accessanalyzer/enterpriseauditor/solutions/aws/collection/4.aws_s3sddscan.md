__Step 5 –__ On the Sensitive Data Settings page, configure the following options:

- Enable differential scanning
- Modify the number of SDD scan processes

  ___RECOMMENDED:___ For optimal performance, the total number of scan processes on a scan host should be 1 to 2 times the number of CPU threads available.
- Enable Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scans

  __NOTE:__ The OCR option is intended to work for clear scanned physical documents or documents directly converted to images, with standard fonts. It will not work for scanning photos of documents and may not be able to recognize text on images of credit cards, driver's licenses, or other identity cards.
