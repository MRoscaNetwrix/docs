__Step 1 –__ From Programs and Features (__Control Panel__ > __Programs__ > __Programs and Features__), uninstall the previous version of SharePoint Agent.

__NOTE:__ If you have the old Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On installed, you must uninstall it before continuing with this upgrade. For Access Analyzer 12.0, Sensitive Data Discovery is installed as part of the main installation if your license includes it.

__Step 2 –__ Install the new version of the SharePoint Agent. See the [Installing the SharePoint Agent](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/install/sharepointagent/wizard.md) topic for instructions.

Now that the SharePoint Agent has been upgraded, it can be used by the SharePoint Solution. See the [SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/solutions/sharepoint/overview.md) topic for additional information.
