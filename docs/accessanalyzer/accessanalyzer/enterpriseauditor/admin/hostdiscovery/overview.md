# Host Discovery Node

Use the __Host Discovery__ node to discover hosts to audit. Host Discovery queries are created in the Host Discovery node to discover hosts within the targeted environment that match the desired criteria (for example, all domain controllers for Active Directory auditing).

The Host Discovery queries view displays a list of previously configured queries, opens the Host Discovery Wizard to create new queries, and is where host inventory process can be automated. The __Host Discovery__ node houses the Discovery Log. The __Settings__ > __Host Discovery__ node contains the global settings that affect discovery queries. See the [Host Discovery](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/hostdiscovery.md) topic for additional information.

The Discovery node has four main panes:

- [Host Discovery Queries](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/hostdiscovery/queries.md)
- [Host Discovery Queries Activities Pane](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/hostdiscovery/activities.md)
- [Host Discovery Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/hostdiscovery/wizard/overview.md)
- [Discovery Log](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/hostdiscovery/log.md)
