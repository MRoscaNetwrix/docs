# Box: Additional Scoping

The Additional Scoping page is where the scan can be limited by depth of the scan. It is a wizard page for the Scan Box Permissions category.

Configure the scan depth level:

- Limit scanned depth to: [number] level – Select the checkbox and set the scan depth level to the desired depth. If this checkbox is not selected, then the entire Box environment will be scanned, according to the [Box: Exclusions Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/datacollector/box/exclusions.md) settings. If the scoping depth is set to __0__ then only root will be scanned. Each increment will add another level of depth from root level.
