# ExchangePublicFolder:Â Properties

The Properties page is where properties that will be gathered are selected. It is a wizard page for all of the categories.

Properties can be selected individually or you can use the __Select All__, __Clear All__, or __Reset All__ buttons. All selected properties will be gathered. The __Message Classes__ button opens the Message classes filters window.

The wildcard (```*```) returns all message class filters. Enter the name of a class filter and click __Add__ to add it to the list. __Delete__ will remove the selected class filter from the list. The __Load defaults__ option will restore the class filter default settings.
