# Save Selected To List

Use the __Save Selected To List__ option to create a static host list. This option is available from either the Host Management node or an individual host list node. See the [Static Host Lists](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/hostmanagement/lists.md#Static-Host-Lists) topic for additional information on static host lists. This option is inactive until at least one host within the data grid is selected.

Use the Windows Ctrl + left-click function to select multiple hosts from the data grid. In the Activities pane, click __Save Selected To List__. The Host List Wizard opens with the selected hosts in the Host list box on the Manual Host Entry page. See the [Add Hosts](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/hostmanagement/actions/add.md) topic for information on creating a host list.
