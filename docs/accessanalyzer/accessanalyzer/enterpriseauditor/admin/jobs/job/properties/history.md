# History Tab

The History tab is for configuring the Data Retention and Log Retention periods. Choose either to use the default settings, which could be either the global configuration or configuration set via broken inheritance at a job group level, or to configure settings just for this job.

By default, all jobs are set to inherit the Data Retention Period and Log Retention Period settings, the __Use Default Setting__ option. Deselect the __Use Default Settings__ option to configure custom settings for the job. Then provide the desired Data Retention Period and Log Retention Period settings. See the [History](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/history.md) topic for additional information.

Click __OK__ to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click __Cancel__ if no changes were made.
