# Instant Job Wizard

The Access Analyzer Instant Job Wizard provides access to a library of instant solutions and instant jobs, which are pre-configured for Access Analyzer. Instant solutions contain groups of jobs to help solve a wide range of problems within each category. Instant jobs help solve specific problems. The instant solutions available align to an organization’s license key. See the[Solutions](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/solutions/overview.md) topic for additional information.
