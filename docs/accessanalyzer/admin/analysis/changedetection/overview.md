# Change Detection Analysis Module

Use the Change Detection analysis module to track changes within a specific Access Analyzer view or
table for use in reporting and notifications. This module tracks additional, changed, or missing
selected data items and compares result rows from previous collection activity with rows from the
most recent collection.

This module compares values collected for two different query instances. Therefore, as change
detection depends on the existence of a **JobRunTimeKey**, history must be enabled and data
collected at least twice to produce the desired results. Configure History settings under the jobâ€™s
**Settings** > **History** node. See the [History](../../settings/history.md) topic for additional
information.

## Configuration
