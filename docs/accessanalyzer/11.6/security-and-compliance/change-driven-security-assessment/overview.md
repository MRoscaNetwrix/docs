# Credential & Data Security Assessment Overview

Proper data security begins with a strong foundation. The Credential & Data Security Assessment
(CDSA) provides a deep-dive into the security of your structured and unstructured data, Active
Directory, and Windows infrastructure.

The CDSA job depends upon several Enterprise Auditor solutions for data collection. See the
[Requirements](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/getting-started/requirements/system-requirements.md)
topic for installation and database requirements.

## Supporting Solutions

At a minimum the following solutions need to run prior to the CDSA job to provide the data used to
generate the CDSA presentations:

- .Active Directory Inventory Solution

  - See the
    [.Active Directory Inventory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/active-directory/inventory-reports.md)
    topic for additional information

- Active Directory Solution

  - See the
    [Active Directory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/active-directory/inventory-reports.md)
    topic for additional information

- Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution

  - See the
    [Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/active-directory/permissions-analysis.md)
    topic for additional information

- File System Solution

  - See the
    [File System Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/file-systems/permissions-analysis.md)
    topic for additional information

- Windows Solution

  - See the
    [Windows Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/windows/overview.md)
    topic for additional information

The following additional solutions also provide data to the CDSA job:

- [Entra ID Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/entra-id/inventory-reports.md)
- [AWS Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/cloud-platforms/aws-analysis.md)
- [Box Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/cloud-platforms/box-analysis.md)
- [Dropbox Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/cloud-platforms/dropbox-analysis.md)
- [Exchange Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/solutions/exchange/overview.md)
- [Oracle Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/oracle-analysis.md)
- [SharePoint Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/sharepoint/permissions-analysis.md)
- [SQL Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/solutions/databases/sql-server-analysis.md)

Additionally, the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On also contributes to the CDSA presentations. See
the
[Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On](/docs/accessanalyzer/11.6/accessanalyzer/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md) topic
for additional information.
