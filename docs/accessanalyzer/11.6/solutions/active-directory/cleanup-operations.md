# AD_CleanupProgress Job

The AD_CleanupProgress Job performs checks against Active Directory security best practices in order
to proactively identify critical security configurations that leave Active Directory vulnerable to
attack. The result is a report which provides a listing of findings by severity and category with
corresponding details that can be used to prioritize and remediate security issues.

# Cleanup Job Group

The **Active Directory** > **Cleanup** Job Group identifies potential stale and unused users,
computers, and groups as well as issues with group membership. Remediation workflows are included to
deprovision unnecessary objects.

changes required are enabled. Enabling and executing action modules without consideration can
negatively impact Active Directory.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Run the actions in a test environment before making changes to a production
environment.
