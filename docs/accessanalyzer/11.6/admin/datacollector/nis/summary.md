The Summary page is where configuration settings are summarized. It is a wizard page for both
categories.

Click **Finish** to save configuration changes. If no changes were made, it is a best practice to
click **Cancel** to close the NIS Data Collector Wizard to ensure that no accidental clicks are
saved.
