# Appendix for the StealthAUDIT MAPI CDO Installation Guide

**CAUTION:** The Enterprise Auditor MAPI CDO must be installed first before installing the Microsoft
Exchange MAPI CDO.

Before installing either binary, close the Enterprise Auditor application and ensure the following
requirements have been met:

- Exchange System Manager for Exchange 2003 is not installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console
  server.
- Microsoft Outlook is not installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server.

These programs will interfere with the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO installation and with MAPI
connections if they are installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console server.

Follow these steps to install the Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO.

**Step 1 –** Download and run the ExchangeMapiCDO application from Microsoft.

**NOTE:** The steps may be slightly different than the following. See Microsoft’s website for
additional detail.
