# Job Properties

Jobs can be configured to inherit global settings down through parent job groups or to be
individually configured at the job level through the Job Properties window.

![Open Job Properties from Jobs Tree](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/hostmanagement/jobstree.webp)

To configure a job’s properties, open the Job Properties window by right-clicking on the job's node
in the Navigation pane and selecting **Properties**.

The properties can be configured at the job level within the Job Properties window using the
following tabs:

- [General Tab](general.md)
- [Performance Tab](performance.md)
- [Notification Tab](notification.md)
- [Report Settings Tab](reportsettings.md)
- [Report Roles Tab](reportroles.md)
- [Storage Tab](storage.md)
- [Connection Tab](connection.md)
- [Auto Retry Tab](autoretry.md)
- [History Tab](history.md)

You can click the **View XML** button at the bottom of the window to open the job’s XML file. See
the [View Job XML File](viewxml.md) for additional information.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if
no changes were made.
