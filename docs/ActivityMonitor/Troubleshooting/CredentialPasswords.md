# Update Credential Passwords

Credential passwords occasionally need to be updated due to various reasons, such as security policies that require passwords to be reset on a regular basis. The following types of credentials may be impacted by password changes or security policies:

- Panzura MQ Protection
- Agent Inactivity Alerts Email Credentials
- Monitored Host Inactivity Alerts Email Credentials

See the [Connection Tab](/Admin/Agents/Properties/Connection.md "Connection Tab") topic for additional information.

See the [Archiving Tab](/Admin/Agents/Properties/Archiving.md "Archiving Tab") topic for additional information.

## Panzura MQ Protection

The Panzura MQ Protection Credentials are used to send activity to the Activity Monitor agent. The credentials can be updated in the agent properties under the **Panzura** tab.

See the [Panzura Tab](/Admin/Agents/Properties/Panzura.md "Panzura Tab") topic for additional information.

## Monitored Host User Credentials

See the [Nutanix Tab](/Admin/MonitoredHosts/Properties/Nutanix.md "Nutanix Tab") topic for additional information.
