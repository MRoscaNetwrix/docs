# Policy Templates: Network Port Tracker

The **Network Port Tracker** is designed to detect track changes to the open network ports on either
a single device, or a range/group of devices. The Tracker uses a range of network-scanning
approaches, either probing a device externally via the network to determine whether TCP and UDP
ports are open or not, or using a local command on the device, such as `netstat`. Remote, external
scans are executed from a Netwrix Agent and utilizes an NMAP instance installed locally to the
Agent.

This means that there are three scanning options available:

- **Self-Scan** - Local Agent scans the local host using the local netstat. The same agent can run a
  full template including all other Tracker types.
- **Remote Scan** – A remote Agent scans the host/device. In this mode, the remote device is
  configured as a Proxied device for the Agent being used, and therefore for other Trackers to be
  run against the Proxied Device, credentials will be required e.g. Cisco Firewall running config
  can also be tracked if valid credentials are assigned.
- **Network Scan** – A Agent can be used to scan a range of devices. In this instance the ‘device’
  is defined as ‘The Network’ or ‘New York Office LAN’, with the address range defined as
  ‘192.168.1.1-255, or 192.168.1.18 192.168.1.19 192.168.1.20-100’, i.e. individually specified
  addresses space separated, ranges defined using a -

The **NMAP** package must be installed to a default program file location (Windows: Program
Files(x86)\Nmap), Linux: /usr/bin/)

The **Network Port Tracker** is configured by specifying port ranges to include and exclude from the
scan. In addition, the protocol used for each range can also be selected, either TCP, UDP or both.

**NOTE:** As with any UDP scan, the non-acknowledged nature of UDP requires a more intensive, slower
approach which may result in scan times exceeding 24 hours.
