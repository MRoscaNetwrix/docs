# Planned Changes Tab

Change Tracker’s Closed-Loop Intelligent Change Control reconciles the security benefits of forensic
change control with the detailed workload necessary to review changes.

Changes are automatically assessed against expected changes to the configuration baseline,
delivering all the benefits of zero tolerance to unplanned changes and a super-sensitive breach
detection capability, but without the time-consuming, resource-intensive post-implementation review
burden.

By automatically reducing the background noise of pre-approved changes such as known patching
updates, any unplanned changes - which may be breach activity - are exposed and can be investigated.

- Planned Change definitions can either be recorded from a device in planned change recording mode,
  or built from the Events page using the Actions button – Rules comprising the Planned Change
  definition are shown using the Show Rules button, and can be edited using the Settings > Planned
  Changes page.
- Click on any Planned Change title to view the Planned Change activity and the Devices enrolled.
- Planned Change Schedules and Rulesets are modular so can be re-used and modified – click on either
  the Schedule Name or Rule Set to see details.
- The Planned Changes screen works in conjunction with the Groups & Device/Date & Time range filter
  controls. An additional Planned Change filter is also provided to show just the Planned Changes of
  interest.
- Equally the Query/Report functions are the same as for the Events screen.

**NOTE:** The **Show Rules** button is for non-admin users and shows a ‘read only’ view of rules.
Click alongside any Planned Change Schedule Name to display a graphical view of changes and a full
list of devices with changes below.
