# Overview Tab

The concept of this page is to give an at a glance view of the trend in compliance with your adopted
hardened build standard – is it being maintained or improved or in decline?

Device compliance is displayed in the **Compliance Report** – all devices assigned the report
selected will be displayed.

- Device/Time Filters – Content is controlled by your Device/Group/Time filters.
- **Dashboardlets per policy/grouping** – For each group and report, an additional Dashboardlet will
  be displayed, allowing you to run a variety of compliance reports against the same Group of
  systems, for example, PCI and NIST 800-53.
- **Risk by Group** – A Risk score can be assigned via the **Settings** -> **Groups** page, this
  provides an added dimension to prioritize focus on groups. See the
  [Device Groups](/docs/changetracker/8.0/admin/settings/devicegroups.md)
  topic for additional information.
