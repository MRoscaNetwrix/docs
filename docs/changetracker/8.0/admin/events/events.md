# Events Tab

Investigate and review any events for devices using powerful filter controls. Events can be
acknowledged then used to create new Planned Change rules.

**Step 1 –** Select a Device Group or All Devices then check any Devices to view events.

**Step 2 –** Make sure the ‘**Device Group**’ selector, found in the top left-hand corner of the
screen shows ‘All Devices’ and check the ‘**Automatically refresh page**’ box.

**Step 3 –** Click **Filter** to precisely focus on events of interest – specify time range,
attribute type, change type and keywords.

**Step 4 –** The **Query/Report** button can be used to specify events to include in a scheduled
report or re-useable query for users. See the
[Reports Tab](/docs/changetracker/8.0/admin/reportstab/reportstab.md) topic for
additional information.

**Step 5 –** Select **Events** of interest then use **Actions** to either acknowledge or
create/expand a Planned Change definition – use Resubmit to then review other previous events
automatically for inclusion within the Planned Change ID.

**NOTE:** Right-click while hovering over an event to invoke the Quick Export, Quick Filter and
Resubmit options. Using a combination of these functions, you can quickly focus in on exactly the
event type or period of interest
