# What's New

## New Netwrix Community!

All Netwrix product announcements have moved to the new Netwrix Community. See announcements for
Netwrix Change Tracker in the [Change Tracker](https://community.netwrix.com/c/98) area of our new
community.

The following information highlights the new and enhanced features introduced in this Netwrix Change
Tracker v8.0 release.

Netwrix Change Tracker 8.0 Goes Agentless

With the release of 8.0, Netwrix Change Tracker introduces a series of new features to further
streamline and simplify its enterprise-grade IT infrastructure change management.

Agentless Compliance Reporting for Windows

Responding to one of our customers’ most popular demands, starting with version 8.0, Netwrix Change
Tracker introduces its agentless version for Windows.

Seamless Splunk Integration

With 8.0, Netwrix Change Tracker introduces an API integration with Splunk. Capturing changes
directly from Splunk provides Netwrix Change Tracker with a simplified form of agentless monitoring
and the ability to monitor devices, databases, and custom applications that currently lack native
support.

Enhanced ServiceNow Integration

The 8.0 release turns ServiceNow into a one-stop-shop for managing devices as Netwrix Change Tracker
can sync any changes in real-time.

- Device Discovery – With the addition of Device Discovery to the ServiceNow integration, devices
  can be imported and made ready for agentless scanning in seconds.
- Incident Handling – It is now possible to raise incidents in ServiceNow for unplanned changes that
  will notify the owners of the changed device. From here they can manage their investigation and
  close the change management loop by resolving the incident.
