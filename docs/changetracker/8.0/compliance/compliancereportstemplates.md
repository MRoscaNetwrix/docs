# Template Management

As a Center for Internet Security (CIS) Certified Vendor, Netwrix provides configuration audit
reports from the acknowledged industry-authority in secure configuration guidance, the CIS
Benchmarks.

Many these are pre-packed with Netwrix Change Tracker but additional templates are always being
produced for new or updated platforms.

To import a new template or update an existing one, just upload the template: use the
‘**Overwrite**’ option if updating.

## Reports Layout Templates Administration

Formats used for the various reports produced by Netwrix Change Tracker Gen 7 are controlled via a
series of underlying templates. New templates, or updated versions of existing templates, can be
added to the system here. The **Version** and **Change Date** details for each report are displayed
and when a new version is available, either after a Gen 7 version upgrade or by manually uploading a
new template through the UI, this can be updated, or the current format preserved if necessary.

For report template modifications or new formats, please contact
[Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html).
