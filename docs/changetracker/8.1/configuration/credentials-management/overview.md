# Credentials

The credentials page is accessible from the Settings menu. This is where credentials used to connect
to remote devices and services are created and managed.

The page is a list of grids containing credentials for different types of device, protocol or
service. While some grids may only be visible if certain licensees or options are in place, this is
the full list:

- ITSM System Credentials
- Cloud System Credentials
- SSH / Telnet Credentials
- Splunk Credentials
- ESXi / vCenter Credentials
- Database Credentials

Each grid has a button to create a new credential. The far right column contains buttons to edit and
delete specific credentials.

## ITSM System Credentials

These credentials are used to connect to an ITSM and discover devices to scan from the ITSM's
