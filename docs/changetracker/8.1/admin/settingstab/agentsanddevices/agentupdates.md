# Agent Updates

When a new agent version is released and downloaded from the customer portal, it can be uploaded to
the Hub. It is then possible deploy the agent update to all (or specific) devices from within the
console. The deployment can be instant or scheduled.

An agent update is comprised of two zip files. One is a new set of program files, the other is a upd
file, which signs the update to confirm its integrity.

The Agent Updates page can be found in the Settings menu. The Actions button on this page has an
option to Upload an Agent Update.
