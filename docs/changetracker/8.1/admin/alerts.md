# User Notifications

Once devices have been assigned to Device Groups and a Configuration Template has been assigned, a
Baseline of the configuration will be recorded and thereafter, any changes detected can be reported
as email or syslog alerts.

Each Netwrix Change Tracker user can be assigned a personalized alerting profile from a range of
event options for each Device Group.

Access the **User Notification Email** page via **Settings** -> **User Notification Emails** and
select a user, then dial in **Notification Types** for the selected Device Group.

**NOTE:** Core system settings such as the Syslog Server and SMTP details will also need to be
defined via **Settings** -> **System Settings** in the Change Tracker . See the
[System Settings](/docs/changetracker/8.1/admin/settings/systemsettings.md) topic for additional information.
