# Hub

**NOTE:** Ensure the Hub's requirements are met and that the server has had any OS updates applied
and has been restarted. See the [Hub Installation for Windows](../requirements/windowsserver.md)
topic for additional information.

A crucial decision to make before installing Change Tracker is how to have Change Tracker store it's
data. Change Tracker uses the MongoDB database to store all of it's event data and configuration.
The most common approach (and the default) is to run the installer and allow it to install the
version of MongoDB that is shipped with it. This will be the latest patch to the latest Long Term
Support (LTS) version of the community edition of MongoDB. This edition of MongoDB lacks many of the
features available in the Enterprise edition as described in MongoDB's
[Upgrade MongoDB Community to MongoDB Enterprise](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/upgrade-community-to-enterprise/)
article.

Change Tracker can also be configured to use and existing instance of MongoDB instead of the bundled
community edition. This is useful if any of the following are required or desirable:

- MongoDB Enterprise Edition
- A clustered install of MongoDB
- Full control of the MongoDB installation

**CAUTION:** No matter the edition of MongoDB or where it is installed, regular patching and backups
must be planned and managed.

## Installation

The installer can be downloaded from the customer portal. The installer employes a wizard to enable
configuration of the installation. Running a later version of the installer on a server that already
has a Change Tracker Hub installed will update the installation.

localhost to have the installer deploy it's built-in version of MongoDB Community edition.
