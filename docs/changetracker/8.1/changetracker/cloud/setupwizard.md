**Step 3 –** Create a new Cloud System and Credentials: The Cloud Set-Up Wizard is context-sensitive
so depending on which Cloud Platform you select will determine the Credentials dialogue you will be
presented with next.

Google Cloud Platform Credentials example:

**NOTE:** Just click the Query icon to get a quick tip on what the Credential field requires.

- Credential Name – Enter a name to uniquely identify these credentials
- Cloud Platform – Select from the drop-down options presented
- Description – Optionally provide a credential description

Once Credentials have been entered, Change Tracker will automatically select an Agent to run the
Cloud Compliance Report from and then run a test of the Credentials. By default, the Agent selected
will be the local Agent on the Hub Server.

**NOTE:** This must always be the latest Net Core Gen 7 Agent. See the
[Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html) site for more details.

This can be changed using the links displayed once the Credentials test has completed, and in the
event that the Credentials are not working for any reason, you will now have the opportunity to edit
them and verify they have been entered correctly.

Cloud security is higher and more complex than standard access credentials for regular servers and
hypervisors so please ask for help if needed!

At this point you are ready to run your first Cloud Compliance Report – just hit the Run Report
button!

### Special Instructions for AWS Cloud Reporting

The NNT Cloud Tracker feature set utilizes the Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets for AWS.

You may experience a failure message after the Credentials Test has run: "Cannot execute AWS
commands, error: The specified module 'AWSPowerShell. NETCore was not loaded because no valid module
file was found in any module directory".

In this case it will be necessary to run the following PowerShell setup on the host running the
Gen7Agent NETCore being used for Cloud Tracker work:

**Step 1 –** Install PowerShell NETCore version 7.x (NB this is not the old PowerShell that is
packaged with Windows, but a new cross-platform version based on NETCore). See the Microsoft
[Installing the MIS package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows#installing-the-mis-package)
article for additional information.

Although the agent provides its own PowerShell scripting, this NETCore version of PowerShell must be
installed in order that the various AWS/Azure etc. PowerShell core support libraries can be
installed. These are used by some Change Tracker reports to collect data from the cloud
environments.

**Step 2 –** Install AWS Cmdlets for use in AWS compliance reports, run the following in the
PowerShell NETCore command prompt (PowerShell 7(x64) Start menu item, Run As Administrator).

`Install`-Module -name AWSPowerShell.NetCore -scope `AllUsers`

Azure Platform Credentials Example:

- Tenant ID – From the Azure portal, click properties and copy the Tenant Id
- Application ID – The Azure application (client) ID
- ClientSecret – The application client secret

### Special Instructions for Azure Cloud Reporting

The NNT Cloud Tracker feature set utilizes the Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets for AWS.

You may experience a failure message after the Credentials Test has run: "Cannot execute Az
commands, error on Import-Module: The specified module 'Az' was not loaded because no valid module
file was found".

In this case it will be necessary to run the following PowerShell setup on the host running the
Gen7Agent NETCore being used for Cloud Tracker work:

**Step 1 –** Install PowerShell NETCore version 7.x (NB this is not the old PowerShell that is
packaged with windows, but a new cross-platform version based on netcore). See the Microsoft
[Installing the MIS package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows#installing-the-mis-package)

**Step 2 –** Install Azure Cmdlets for use in Azure compliance reports, run the following in the
PowerShell NETCore command prompt (PowerShell 7(x64) Start menu item, Run As Administrator):

Install-Module -name Az -`scope` AllUsers
