# Policy Templates: Installed Software and Updates

__NOTE:__ This template applicable to Windows OS only.

Software installations and updates are critical dimensions of a host’s configuration. It is therefore essential that these are tracked and recorded from compliance, security, and configuration management perspectives.

Enabling the Tracker is simple – check the __Track Installs and Windows Updates__ box and then save the settings to the device. Changes will be detected on a scheduled, polled basis, with the frequency governed by the __Repeat__ setting. A __No Repeat__ setting will ensure a poll only occurs on a server re-boot which may be appropriate for a host with tightly governed resources.
