# Policy Templates: Security and Audit Policy Tracker

__NOTE:__ This template applicable to Windows OS only.

Netwrix Change Tracker can be used to track changes to an extended range of __Security Settings__ covered by the __Audit__ and __Security__ policies.

The majority of critical security settings, user permissions and audit policy specifications are defined in the __Local Security Policy__, either directly or via __Group Policy__.

There is minimal configuration required to activate the Tracker – just check the __Track security and audit policy settings in this template__ box and define the poll period then save settings to the Template. Any changes to the initial baseline will be alerted and reported.
