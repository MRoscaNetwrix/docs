# Sample Scripts:

__NOTE:__ For script debugging and advanced scripting requirements, you may find it easier to use the ‘__Script Console__’ packaged with any Proxy Agent installation. You can run the Script Console from _C:\Program Files\NNT Change Tracker Suite\Gen7Agent (NetCore)\NNT.Script.Console.exe_ program name __NNT.Script.Console.exe__

The sample scripts provided in this section all include a Main Script and a Logon Script dialogue, however, for Production Agentless Tracker’s, the Logon script only is used within the Credentials key with the Main Script commands being configured with the relevant Configuration Template.
