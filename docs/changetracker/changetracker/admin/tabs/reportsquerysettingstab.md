# Report Options

For any of the built-in reports, the __Query Settings__ are available for:

- Events Report
- Executive Report
- Planned Changes Report
- Configuration Templates Report

See the [Export Reports](eventsexportreports.md) topic for additional information.

__NOTE:__ The __Configuration Template__ report has a context-sensitive option for Query Settings, allowing selection of all Policy Templates to include in the report. Often an auditor will request details of configuration attributes being tracked and this report provides a convenient way to extract these on a scheduled basis.
