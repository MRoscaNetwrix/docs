# Events Tab

Investigate and review any events for devices using powerful filter controls. Events can be acknowledged then used to create new Planned Change rules.

__Step 1 –__ Select a Device Group or All Devices then check any Devices to view events.

__Step 2 –__ Make sure the ‘__Device Group__’ selector, found in the top left-hand corner of the screen shows ‘All Devices’ and check the ‘__Automatically refresh page__’ box.

__Step 3 –__ Click __Filter__ to precisely focus on events of interest – specify time range, attribute type, change type and keywords.

__Step 4 –__ The __Query/Report__ button can be used to specify events to include in a scheduled report or re-useable query for users. See the [Reports Tab](/docs/changetracker/changetracker/admin/tabs/reportstab.md) topic for additional information.

__Step 5 –__ Select __Events__ of interest then use __Actions__ to either acknowledge or create/expand a Planned Change definition – use Resubmit to then review other previous events automatically for inclusion within the Planned Change ID.

__NOTE:__ Right-click while hovering over an event to invoke the Quick Export, Quick Filter and Resubmit options. Using a combination of these functions, you can quickly focus in on exactly the event type or period of interest
