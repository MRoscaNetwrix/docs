# User Notifications

Once devices have been assigned to Device Groups and a Configuration Template has been assigned, a Baseline of the configuration will be recorded and thereafter, any changes detected can be reported as email or syslog alerts.

Each Netwrix Change Tracker user can be assigned a personalized alerting profile from a range of event options for each Device Group.

Access the __User Notification Email__ page via __Settings__ -> __User Notification Emails__ and select a user, then dial in __Notification Types__ for the selected Device Group.

__NOTE:__ Core system settings such as the Syslog Server and SMTP details will also need to be defined via __Settings__ -> __System Settings__ in the Change Tracker . See the [System Settings](/docs/product_docs/changetracker/changetracker/admin/settings/systemsettings.md) topic for additional information.
