The top of the page displays a profile card which may contain the following information about the role:

* Description

* Enabled
* Object ID
* Object Type
* Tenant

## Members Tab

The members tab displays two tables:

* Eligible Assignments – Lists the roles that the user is eligible for. An eligible assignment refers to a role assignment that a user or group can activate when needed but is not permanently active.
* Active Assignments – Lists roles that are currently active and usable to a user.

Both tables have the following columns:

* Name – The display name of the member
* Type – The object type
* Scope – Defines the boundary within which the assigned role permissions are valid
* Inherited from – How the eligible assignment was inherited
* Assignment Type – How was the active role assignment assigned
* Start Time – When the member is eligible for the role
* End Time – When the role eligibility expires
