* Full Netwrix Threat Manager version 3.0.473+ or RO 3.0.90+ is installed

See the Microsoft [MSAL.js 2.0 is now generally available with support for authorization code flow](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/msal-js-2-0-supports-authorization-code-flow-is-now-generally-available/ "MSAL.js 2.0 is now generally available with support for authorization code flow") article for additional information.

First, you need to register an application for Threat Manager in Microsoft Entra ID and then use the registered application's information for configuring Microsoft Entra ID OpenID Connect in Threat Manager.
