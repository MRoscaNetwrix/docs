# Type of Threats

Netwrix Threat Manager by default provides some pre-configured threats and users can create custom threats using the Custom option or through the Create Threat option on the Investigation page. The pre-defined and custom threats are listed in the Threat box. Threats that are crossed out are disabled threats.

![Threats Box](../../../../../static/images/ThreatManager_3.0/Content/Resources/Images/ThreatManager/Admin/Configuration/ThreatDetection/ThreatsBox.png "Threats Box")

The Threats list divides the threats into the following sections:

* [Active Directory Threats](ActiveDirectory "Active Directory Threats")
* [Entra ID Threats](EntraID "Entra ID Threats")
* [File System Threats](FileSystem "File System Threats")
* [General Threats](General "General Threats")
* [Custom Threats](Custom "Custom Threats")

Select a threat from the list to display the threat's configuration options to the right of the Threats box.
