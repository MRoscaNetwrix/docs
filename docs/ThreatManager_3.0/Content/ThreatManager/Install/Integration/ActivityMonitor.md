# Netwrix Activity Monitor Integration

The Activity Monitor can be configured to send file system data and/or Active Directory and/or Microsoft Entra ID data to Threat Manager. It must be installed and configured to monitor the target environment. See the [Netwrix Activity Monitor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor "Netwrix Activity Monitor") documentation for additional information.

In order for Threat Manager to receive the event stream data, the Activity Monitor must be configured to do so. For file system activity events, use the Threat Manager Syslog template for the desired monitored host configuration. For Active Directory activity events, generate an App Token in Threat Manager and then use that app token to configure the domainâ€™s output to Threat Manager.

The Threat Manager DC Sync threat is sourced by the Activity Monitor's Replication AD monitoring configuration. It is necessary for it to be configured to exclude domain controllers on the Host (From) filter.
