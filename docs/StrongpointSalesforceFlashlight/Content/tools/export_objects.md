# Export Objects

Administrators can use this to export one or more objects, including all child objects, into a single view for easy review and management. For each export, you select the settings and optional profiles and permission sets to include in the object details. The export is done in the background to avoid timing out or exceeding the Salesforce Governor Limits. You will receive an email with a link to the [Export Object Attachment](export_object_attachment_records "Open Export Object Attachment record") record, where you can download your file.

:::note
NOTE: Strongpoint stores Object-level permissions in a Custom Object. There are two reports (Flashlight > Reports / List Views > Customizations) for easy access to this information:Permissions by ObjectObject Permissions by Profile

The *ObjectExport.xls* file contains a **Summary** tab and a separate tab for each selected object.
