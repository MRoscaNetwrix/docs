# Using the Dashboard

Flashlight comes with a comprehensive dashboard with everything to manage your org at your fingertips. The dashboard provides key tools and reports to enable you to take full control of your org and action problematic areas as required.

* [Scanner Status](#spider_status)
* [Recent Updates to Customizations](#Recent)
* [Resources](#resources)
* [Key Tools](#key_tools)
* [DRD Generator](#erd_generator)

## Scanner Status

Displays the current status of the scanner (Not Started, In Progress, Completed) and the number of days since the scanner was last run. It is recommended to run the scanner every week so your org documentation is up-to-date.
