# Manage Alerts

For your convenience, Netwrix provides you with a set of predefined alerts that are commonly used for IT infrastructure monitoring. The out-of-the-box alerts include those that help you detect suspicious activity and inform you on critical changes to your environment. The alerts contain pre-configured filters and in most cases you only need to enable an alert and select who will receive notifications.

You can add any elements (a dashboard, report, alert, risk, etc.) to the Auditor Home screen to access them instantly. See the [Navigation](../Navigation/Overview "Navigation") and [Customize Home Screen](../Navigation/CustomizeHome "Customize Home screen") topics for additional information.
