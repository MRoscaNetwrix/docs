You can add any elements (a dashboard, report, alert, risk, etc.) to the Auditor Home screen to access them instantly. See the [Navigation](../Navigation/Overview "Navigation") and [Customize Home Screen](../Navigation/CustomizeHome "Customize Home screen") topics for additional information.

The dashboards includes the following sections:

* The Risk score timeline that helps you review anomaly surges over time.
* The Risk score by top five users chart that helps you identify the most active users. To see the chart, click the pie chart icon in the upper left corner of the page.
* The user list with all users who provoked alerts and their total risk scores.

Once you reviewed the general anomaly trend and identified users that merit your special attention, review their profiles and process anomalies. Click View Profile next to a user name to dive into user activity and investigate each action in details. [Review User Profiles and Process Anomalies](UserProfile)
