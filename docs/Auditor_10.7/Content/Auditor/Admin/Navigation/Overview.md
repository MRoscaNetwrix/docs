Starting with version 10, the home screen in Netwrix Auditor is customizable so you can instantly get access to the information that is most relevant to you. This section covers the tiles are available and how you can use them to create the home screen that works best for you. It also illustrates the customization process with several common scenarios.

## Home Screen Tiles

Home Screen Tiles in the Netwrix Auditor provide an interface that allows users to access main information. The following tiles are displayed on the initially configured Home Screen:

* [Welcome to Netwrix Auditor Tile](#Welcome "Welcome to Netwrix Auditor Tile")
* [Audit Intelligence Tiles](#AuditInt "Audit Intelligence Tiles")
* [Configuration Tile](#Configur "Configuration Tile")

### Welcome to Netwrix Auditor Tile

The Welcome to Netwrix Auditor Tile tile provides a checklist you can use to get started collecting and viewing data about your IT ecosystem.

* The "Create a monitoring plan" link prompts you to create a monitoring plan for at least one data source (such as Active Directory, Exchange Online or network devices). For detailed instructions on how to create a monitoring plan, see the [Monitoring Plans](../MonitoringPlans/Overview "Monitoring Plans") topic for additional information. Wait until the initial data collection completes.

* Clicking the second link opens a dashboard that lists all the monitoring plans you’ve created, along with the status and last activity time for each. Review this list and address any errors or warnings. See the [Monitoring Overview](../HealthStatus/Dashboard/MonitoringOverview "Monitoring Overview") topic for additional information.

* Once have created a monitoring plan and verified that it is properly configured, run one or more searches to get insights into your IT infrastructure. See the [View and Search Collected Data](../Search/Overview "View and Search Collected Data") topic for additional information.

When you have completed these three steps, you can close this tile by clicking the "Close" link at the bottom. The checklist will be replaced by statistics across your audited systems. See the [Customize Home Screen](CustomizeHome "Customize Home Screen") topic for additional information.
