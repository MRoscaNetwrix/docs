1. Open the **File Server REST API Explorer** REST API client using the following URL:   
   `https://:9440/api/nutanix/v3/api_explorer/index.html#/`  
     
   here `` - IP address of the Nutanix File Server to be audited.

If you select to launch the RestAPI Explorer from the Prism menu, the **RestAPI Explorer for Prism** server will be opened.

2. In the **username** and **password** fields, enter the credentials of the [Create User Account to Access Nutanix REST API](UserAccount) you have created.
