# Review Instances

After a review has been completed, it can be run again, which creates multiple instances of the review. Each instance is identified by date timestamps indicating its start and end times.

***RECOMMENDED:*** Prior to running another review instance, ensure the most up to date information is available to owners for review.

On the Manage Reviews page in the Entitlement Reviews interface, a review with a Completed status can be started again. Select the review and click **Run Again**. The Create Review wizard opens without the Review Type page. The review can be run as-is by navigating through the wizard with the **Next** buttons, or you can modify as desired. Completing the wizard process restarts the review. See the [Create Review Wizard](Wizard/Create "Create Review Wizard") topic for additional information.
