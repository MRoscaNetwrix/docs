# Add Owner Window

The Add Owner window opens from either the [Add New Resource Wizard](../Wizard/Add "Add New Resource Wizard") of the [Update Resource Wizard](../Wizard/Update "Update Resource Wizard"). This window is used to search for a user account by browsing Active Directory.

Enter a name in the search field to find and select users from Active Directory, which populates in a drop-down menu as you type. If multiple domains are known to the application, ensure the correct domain is selected from the drop-down menu. Click **OK** and the Add Owner window closes. The selected user appears in the Owner list.
