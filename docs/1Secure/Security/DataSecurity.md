# Data Security

## Data at rest

## Data in transit

Data will be transferred between the system components in a few different ways:

- Agent -> API
- API -> SQL Database
- SQL Database -> Application
- Application -> Browser (User)

Data is always encrypted in transit, and connections are made over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping.

## Data Retention Period

Data retention is the practice of storing and managing your data and records for a designated period of time. A data retention period refers to the amount of time that a company or an organization holds onto your information. Netwrix 1Secure provides data retention for 1 rolling year by default.
