# Customer Data Privacy

All customers access Netwrix 1Secure via the same address:

- [https://1secure.netwrix.com/](https://1secure.netwrix.com/ "https://1secure.netwrix.com/")

- If you select the Americas, your data is stored in the Microsoft Azure region known as “West Central US”.
- If you select Europe/Africa, your data is stored in the Microsoft Azure region known as “West Europe”.

The region is selected by the user who is signing up for the product. We create a tenant for your organization in that region and guarantee that all your data always stays within that region.

If your company is split across multiple regions, you can select the region where the headquarters are located or, alternatively, have a separate tenant for each region. Please note that in this case Netwrix 1Secure will not provide a company-wide risk score.
