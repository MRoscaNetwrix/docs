# Risk Metrics List

This topic provides a list of all risk metrics included in a risk profile. This list may differ for certain profiles if they have been modified.

| Risk Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Administrative groups (Enumerated) | Minimizing the number of administrative groups helps you understand and control the assignment of powerful permissions, as required for security and compliance. |
| Empty security groups (Enumerated) | Empty security groups with administrative privileges are a potential back door for attackers. Regularly identify and delete empty groups. |
| Improper Number of Global Administrators  (Binary) | Maintain strict control over the number of global administrators to minimize the risk of internal and external threats. Elevated privileges associated with such roles can lead to significant breaches if misused or compromised, disrupting business operations and potentially leading to substantial data loss or compliance violations. |
| Unified Audit Log Search is Not Enabled  (Binary) | Unified Audit Log Search allows for the centralized ingestion and searching of audit logs generated by Office 365 and can be a vital source of data for the investigation and detection of security incidents. It is recommended to enable unified audit log searching. |
| Conditional Access Policy Disables Admin Token Persistence  (Binary) | Looks for Conditional Access policies that disable token persistence for users with admin roles and have a sign-in frequency that is less than or equal to nine hours. When an admin login has their token cached on the client, they are vulnerable for a Primary Refresh Token related attack. |
| MS Graph Powershell Service Principal Assignment Not Enforced  (Binary) | Checks if the assignment for MsGraph Powershell is required. By default, Azure tenants allow all users to access Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module. This allows any authenticated user or guest the ability to abuse Dangerous Default Permissions, as well as enumerate the entire tenant. |
| Third-Party Applications Allowed  (Binary) | Third-party integrated applications are allowed to run in the organization's Office 365 environment if you authorize them to do so. This configuration is considered insecure because a user may grant permissions to a malicious application without fully understanding the security implications. A user who installs a malicious third-party application is in effect compromised. Additionally, there are documented cases of a malicious actor gaining access to sensitive information by enticing a user to allow a third-party integrated application to run within their O365 Tenant. |
