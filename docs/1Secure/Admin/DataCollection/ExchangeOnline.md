Netwrix 1Secure will access the cloud-based Office 365 infrastructure using a dedicated Microsoft Entra ID application, formerly Azure AD. This app should be created manually by user with administrative role and assigned required permissions. See the [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](../../Configuration/EntraID/RegisterConfig.md "App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID") topic for additional information.
