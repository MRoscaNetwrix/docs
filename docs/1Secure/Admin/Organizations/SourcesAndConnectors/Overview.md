# Sources and Connectors

In Netwrix 1Secure, you can add data sources and their connectors to collect data from the following environments:

- Active Drectory
- Computer
- Exchange Online
- Microsoft Entra ID
- SharePoint Online
- SQL Server

Using connectors, Netwrix 1Secure can:

- Read and write data to/from your organizationâ€™s systems
- Connect to your sources for analyzing and processing the data

**NOTE:** Before adding a data source, make sure its prerequisites are met. See the [Prerequisites for Data Sources](../../../Requirements/PrerequisitesForDataSources.md "Prerequisites for Data Sources") topic for additional information.
