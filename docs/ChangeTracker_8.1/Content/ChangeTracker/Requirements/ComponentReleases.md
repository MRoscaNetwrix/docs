# Component Releases

The components listed here are versioned independently of the Hub, therefor each has it's own life cycle.

## End of Support (EOS) Policy

Netwrix will provide full support for a minimum of two versions. With the release of each new software version, Netwrix will publish the End-of-Support (EOS) date for the version entering end of support as part of the release notification.

Once an EOS date has been published, that EOS software version will enter limited support and will have six months until support ceases. The EOS for a software version applies to that version and all hot fixes and service packs issued for that version.
