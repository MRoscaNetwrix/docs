# Quick Export

To export the events displayed, use the Export button â€“ choices of PDF, Excel or csv are provided.

**NOTE:** The events exported will be governed by the filter settings, not simply what is visible on the screen nor selected using the checkboxes against events. To export a subset of displayed events, apply further filter controls then export.
