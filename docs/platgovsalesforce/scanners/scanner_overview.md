# Scanner Overview

The Scanner menu is located on the Netwrix Dashboard page.

- [Scheduler](/docs/platgovsalesforce/scanners/scheduler.md) schedules automatic scans.
- [Manual Scanners](/docs/platgovsalesforce/installing_strongpoint/running_scanner.md) accesses the list of scanners
  where you can select one or more to run. **Manual Scanners** can also be run from **Netwrix
  Dashboard**.
- [Daily Scan Configuration](/docs/platgovsalesforce/scanners/daily_scan.md) enables an administrator to select object types for
  daily scanning, instead of defaulting to all types.
- [Field Level Security Scanner](/docs/platgovsalesforce/scanners/field_level_scanner.md) displays all fields using the selected
  Salesforce object.
