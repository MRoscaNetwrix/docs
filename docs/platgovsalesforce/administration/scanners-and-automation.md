# Manual Scanners

When the initial scan is complete, you can run additional on demand scans as required.

When you add or change a specific customization, you can choose to run an on demand scan of only the
Metadata type of the affected customization, instead of scanning the entire environment. This type
of scan reduces the run time. For example if you change a Report, pick reports as the Metadata type
and Platform Governance for Salesforce only scans reports.

The scanner is only available to Administrators.

To run the scanner:

1. Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Scanner** > **Manual Scanners**
2. Use the optional **Search Types** to narrow the focus of the list if you are looking for a
   specific type.
3. You can select + beside one or more types to scan or you can scan the whole environment by
   clicking + on the **Name** row to select all the types.

4. Click **Run Scanner**.
5. The batch runs in the background. You receive an email notification when the scan is complete.

   You can create your own Salesforce view for the scanners.

   - Open Salesforce **Setup**.
   - Search for **apex jobs** or navigate to **Environments** > **Jobs** > **Apex Jobs**.
   - Click **Create New View**.  
     ![Set up a Strongpoint scanner view](/img/product_docs/platgovsalesforce/installing_strongpoint/scanner_view.webp)
   - Enter a **View Name**. The system assigns **View Unique Name**. _Netwrix Jobs1_ is used in
     this example.
   - Select **Apex Class** for the **Field**.
   - Select **starts with** for the **Operator**.
   - Assign **FLO, Strongpoint** for the **Value**.
   - Click **Save**. You can now see the status of all of the Strongpoint jobs.

# Scanner Overview

The Scanner menu is located on the Netwrix Dashboard page.

- [Scheduler](/docs/platgovsalesforce/administration/scanners-and-automation.md) schedules automatic scans.
- [Manual Scanners](/docs/platgovsalesforce/administration/scanners-and-automation.md) accesses the list of scanners
  where you can select one or more to run. **Manual Scanners** can also be run from **Netwrix
  Dashboard**.
- [Daily Scan Configuration](/docs/platgovsalesforce/administration/scanners-and-automation.md) enables an administrator to select object types for
  daily scanning, instead of defaulting to all types.
- [Field Level Security Scanner](/docs/platgovsalesforce/administration/scanners-and-automation.md) displays all fields using the selected
  Salesforce object.

# Daily Scan Configuration

Administrators can use this feature to only scan specified objects on a daily schedule. The default
is to scan all objects.

Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Scanners** > **Daily Scan Configuration**

![Daily Scan configuration](/img/product_docs/platgovsalesforce/scanners/daily_scan.webp)

1. Select an optional **Category filter**.
2. Select an optional **Sub-Category filter**.
3. Select one or more **Salesforce Types** in the **Available** pane. Click the right arrow to add
   them to the **Selected** pane. You can use the up/down arrows to reorder the selected types.
   Select and use the left arrow to remove a type from the **Selected** pane.
4. Click **Save** to save the configuration.

# Field Level Security Scanner

The Field Level Security Scanner creates a comprehensive list of Customizations, Field APIÂ Name,
Parent Object, Package, and Salesforce Type for a selected Object.

Run the scanners before you search to ensure you have the latest data.

1. Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Scanner** > Field-Level Security Scanner.

   ![Open the Field Level Security Scanner](/img/product_docs/platgovsalesforce/scanners/field_level_scanner.webp)

2. Start typing the name of a **Salesforce Object**. Pick from the completion list.
3. Click **Search Fields**.

   ![Field Level Scanner example](/img/product_docs/platgovsalesforce/scanners/field_level_scanner_example.webp)

4. Select one or more fields to scan. The **Customization Name** is a link to the Customization
   Record.

   **NOTE:** It is not technically possible to scan permissions on all fields in each object.

5. Selected fields are shown in a list at the bottom of the form. You can uncheck individual fields
   or all fields from the **Selected Field** list.

   ![Removal list](/img/product_docs/platgovsalesforce/scanners/field_level_scanner_remove.webp)

6. Click **Run Scanner**.

Once the scan is complete, open the Reports tab and select Field Permissions Report. The report is
also available from the Netwrix Dashboard: **Reports** > **Access Reports** > **Field Permissions**.

# Scheduler

Platform Governance for Salesforce's scheduler creates automated scans, manages scripts, uses the
Agent and finds the date last used (DLU). The schedules are validated to prevent scanners from
running concurrently, potentially causing conflicts and incomplete documentation. A warning message
is displayed if you create an overlapping scanner schedule.

To use the scheduler tool:

1. Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Scanner** > **Scheduler**  
   All categories are initially disabled by default.

   ![scheduler](/img/product_docs/platgovsalesforce/clean_up/scheduler.webp)

2. Select the category to automate by clicking on **Disabled** to enable it. There is no save
   button, automation is turned on and saved by toggling **Disabled**/**Enabled**.
3. Select the **Frequency** , **Day** and **Time**. Your selections are automatically saved.
4. Click any menu item to close the **Scheduler**.
