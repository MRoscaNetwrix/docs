# Ongoing Monitoring

One of Platform Governance for Salesforceâ€™s strengths is that it is built right into Salesforce. You
can use all of your Salesforce administration and configuration skills to efficiently monitor and
organize what is important to you.

Most of the examples so far have used List Views to move Customizations through the Clean Up Process
of identification, assessment, approval and clean up. Reports, when combined with Controls, can
deliver powerful results for your clean up process.

For example, you can set up a Report to search the **XML/Code** or **Changed By** fields of
Customizations for any ongoing situations. You can then set a trigger to update the filters on the
report to include specific people, such as new users. Finally, add a dashboard where you can view
the key metrics from your Report.

The Enterprise Compliance edition enables you to take management to the next level by designating
reports as scheduled automated controls. These controls create situation-specific change logs or
control violation logs that can be reviewed and cleared.

It is easy to build a comprehensive dashboard on the **Control Logs** object in a single
**Unresolved Control Violations** List View to monitor dangerous or simply irritating changes in
configuration or data. You can designate who receives alerts without needing to build new workflows
or triggers.

To learn more about simplifying governance and audit with Enterprise Compliance tools, reach out to
your Customer Success Manager or Account Executive.
