# Creating a Change Request

Change requests are the method to plan, analyze, track and approve changes. You can create different
types of Change Requests to match the change you want to manage. Here are two options:

- **Customization** Change request is used for Metadata changes, such as
  [Customizations](/docs/platgovsalesforce/customizations/customizations_overview.md).
- **Data Record** - Change request is used for Data Changes to Revenue Cloud/
  [CPQ](/docs/platgovsalesforce/changemanagement/enhanced_cpq_support.md).

:::note
Data Record Change Requests are only available with an Enterprise Compliance license.
