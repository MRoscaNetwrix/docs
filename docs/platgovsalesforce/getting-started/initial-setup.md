## Sandbox Options

If you are installing in a sandbox, there is an option for **Change Log Creation**. If **Enabled**,
change logs are created in the sandbox. Due to Salesforce space limits on different
[sandbox accounts](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=data_sandbox_environments.htmandtype=5),
you may want to disable change logs to save space. This option can also be accessed on the
[Configuration and Stats](/docs/platgovsalesforce/administration/platform-configuration.md) page for the sandbox.

Here are the options for a Sandbox installation. Be sure to **Save** each setting you change. Scroll
down to find the Scanner options.
