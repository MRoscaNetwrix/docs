# Reports

The Netwrix Dashboard **Reports** tab has links to all of the predefined reports and log files.

- Access Reports
- Security Reports
- Data Classification
- Customizations
- Clean Up
- Change Enablement
- Release and Deployment
- Audit Reports

You can define and save your own reports.

- Customization objects have additional data to enable searching with complex queries. For example,
  search for _all objects with script dependencies that have not been used for six months_, _or all
  objects used by workflows_.
- You can filter test scripts from regular scripts. Test scripts can be queried to review test
  coverage and determine if they being used.

To access all reports, the following setting must be enabled:  
Open **Strongpoint** > **Scanner** > **Scheduler**  
 **PermissionSet Assignment** and **System Permission** must be **Enabled**, and the **Frequency**
set to **Daily**.  
If you have questions, contact your CSM or Salesforce Specialist.

## Access Reports

These reports are available from **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Reports** > **Access Reports**.

Filters can be used on this report. Use **Save As** for a new version following your company naming
conventions. An elevated access example is to filter **Permissionset/Profile** by the name of the
elevated access profile or permission set, such as **Admin**.

You can focus on sensitive objects by filtering by object name and adding the names of the objects
in the filter using the **contains** keyword plus the name of the object as it appears in object
name. Separate each name with a comma.

> **Permissions by Object**: Displays the permissions on each object for all Permission Sets and
> Profiles.
