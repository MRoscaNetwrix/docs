# Automated Report Clean Up

Reports are powerful tools used throughout Salesforce and interconnected to other customizations. As
user-created Reports proliferate, Salesforce accounts become inefficient and overall performance
degrades. This rules-based tool provides administrators the ability to identify and archive Reports
and keep Salesforce accounts organized, easy to understand, and improve efficiency and performance.
Archived reports can be restored.

The **Automated Report Clean Up** tool has two operating modes:

- **Automatic** - scheduled automated report clean up that runs continuously using all rules marked
  Automatic.
- **Run Now** - starts report clean up that runs once and completes within seven days using current
  clean up rule.

Menu options are available to access the rules and lists:

- Report Clean Up Rules
- Report Clean Up Status
- Archived Reports
- Retained Reports
- Reports To Be Archived

### Report Clean Up Rules

Report Clean Up rules are created by the administrator and used to locate Reports matching the rule
criteria. Report Clean Up rules are used for both Automatic and Run Now.

To create or edit rules, access **Netwrix Dashboard**> **Tools** > **Automated Report Clean Up
Tool**

- **Description** is the purpose of the rule record. An informative description helps administrators
  easily maintain and identify rules.
- **Notify Report Owners Prior to Archive** check to send email to report owners prior to archive.
  Default is checked.
- **Automatic** is used to include the rule in the automated report. This option is not available
  until the **Preview** function has been used.

**Basic Filters**

  _customreport_testing_1_.
- **Months Since Date Last Used, Retained/Restored** filters reports by the last run date of the
  report or the restore/retain date, whichever is the most recent. Reports that have been used,
  restored, or retained within the specified timeframe are excluded from the report. Default is
  **6** months.

  checked.
