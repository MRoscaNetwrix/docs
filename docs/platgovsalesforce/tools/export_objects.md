# Export Objects

Administrators can use this to export one or more objects, including all child objects, into a
single view for easy review and management. For each export, you select the settings and optional
profiles and permission sets to include in the object details. The export is done in the background
to avoid timing out or exceeding the Salesforce Governor Limits. You will receive an email with a
link to the [Export Object Attachment](/docs/platgovsalesforce/tools/export_object_attachment_records.md) record, where you can
download your file. You can also use the **Download Files** link on this page or on the Netwrix
Dashboard to download your file.

You can export **Permissions by Object** or **Object Permissions by Profile/PermSet**.

:::note
Platform Governance for Salesforce stores Object-level permissions in a Custom Object. There are two
reports (**Netwrix Dashboard** > **Reports** > **Access Reports**) for easy access to this
information:
:::

Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Tools** > **Export Objects**  
**Objects** is the default tab.
