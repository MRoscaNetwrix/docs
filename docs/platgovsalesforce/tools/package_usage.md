# Package Usage

The Package Usage tool provides administrators real-time insights into the usage and allocation of
additional product licenses across the organization. This tool enables them to identify potential
cost savings. Used in conjunction with the existing [User Activity](/docs/platgovsalesforce/tools/user_activity.md) tool, it
provides a comprehensive overview of who is accessing the environment and for what purpose.

The Package Usage tool is available with the Intelligent Change Enablement and Enterprise Compliance
[licenses](/docs/platgovsalesforce/installingstrongpoint/features_by_license_type.md).
