The new password must be eight or more characters long. After setting the password, you will need to login with the Builtin Administrator account.

Using the Configuration interface, the Builtin Administrator account can be disabled once a domain account has been granted the Administrator role. You can also change the password for the Builtin Administrator account. See the [Modify the Builtin Administrator Account](configuration/consoleaccess.md#modify-the-builtin-administrator-account) topic for additional information.

After changing the Builtin Administrator password at first launch, you will be asked to login again. The Home page opens. The first thing that should be done is to configure console access for domain users. Additionally, other settings can be configured or modified through the Configuration interface.

See the [URL & Login](login.md) topic for information on how users will log in and where they are directed after login.

See the [Navigation](navigate.md) topic for information on each of the interfaces and portals accessible from the Home page.
