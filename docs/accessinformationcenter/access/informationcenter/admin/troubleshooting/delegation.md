# Service Account Delegation

Delegation can be used to grant the Active Directory service account the minimal rights necessary to allow the Access Information Center to commit changes in Active Directory. Apply delegation to the OUs housing the security and distribution list groups to be managed to grant the rights of Allow Read Members and Allow Write Members to the service account. See the [Commit Active Directory Changes](/docs/accessinformationcenter/access/informationcenter/admin/additionalconfig/commitchanges.md) topic for best practices for group and resource management through the Access Information Center.

Follow the steps to apply delegation to the desired OUs.
