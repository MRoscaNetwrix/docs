# Sensitive Content Details Report

The Sensitive Content Details report at the instance level provides details of tables where criteria matches were found on the selected instance. This report includes a table with criteria matches visible to Access Information Center users with either Security Team Member or Administrator roles. The Matches table requires the storage of discovered sensitive data within the Access Analyzer database or it will be blank.
