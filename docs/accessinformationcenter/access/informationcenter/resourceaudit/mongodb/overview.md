# MongoDB Reports

MongoDB reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the MongoDB resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data within these reports is collected by the Access Analyzer MongoDB solution. See the MongoDB Solution topic in the [Netwrix Access AnalyzerÂ Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer) for additional information.

A single MongoDB Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its own node in the Access Information Center. MongoDB reports fall into the following categories:

- Permissions reports
- Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the __MongoDB__ node:

- [Sensitive Content Summary Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/mongodb/sensitivecontentsummary.md)
