# Exceptions Node Reports

The following report is available at the **Exceptions** node:

- [Exceptions Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/filesystem/exceptions/exceptions.md)

The **Exceptions** node displays when exceptions have been identified on the selected server. When
it is present, it can be expanded to view the exception type level reports. The following nodes may
show under the Exceptions node for a file system resource when that exception type has been
identified:

- Disabled Users – Folders where disabled users have been granted access
- Open resources – Folders that are openly accessible through file shares
- Stale Users – Folders where stale users have been granted access

The Exceptions report for each exception type level displays filtered exception information. See the
[Exceptions Report by Type](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/filesystem/exceptions/exceptionsbytype.md)
topic for the report details.
