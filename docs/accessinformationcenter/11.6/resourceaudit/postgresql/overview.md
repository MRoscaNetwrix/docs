# PostgreSQL Reports

PostgreSQL reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the PostgreSQL
resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The
data within these reports is collected by the Enterprise Auditor PostgreSQL solution. See the
PostgreSQL Solution topic in the
[Netwrix Enterprise AuditorÂ Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer)
for additional information.

A single PostgreSQL Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has
its own node in the Access Information Center. PostgreSQL reports fall into the following
categories:

- Permissions reports
- Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the **PostgreSQL** node:

- [Sensitive Content Summary Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/postgresql/sensitivecontentsummary.md)
