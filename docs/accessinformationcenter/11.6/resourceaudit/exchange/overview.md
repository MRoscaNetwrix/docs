# Exchange Reports

Exchange reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the Exchange resources
by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data
within these reports is collected by the Enterprise Auditor Exchange solution. See the Exchange
Solution topic in the
[Netwrix Enterprise AuditorÂ Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer)
for additional information.

A single Exchange Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its
own node in the Access Information Center. Exchange reports fall into the following categories:

- Permissions reports
- Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the **Exchange** node:

- [Sensitive Content Summary Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/exchange/sensitivecontentsummary.md)
