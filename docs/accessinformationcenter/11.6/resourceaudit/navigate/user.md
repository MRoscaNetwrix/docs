# User Audit Interface

The User Audit interface is opened by searching for a particular Active Directory or Entra ID user.
See the
[Search Features](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/navigate/search.md)
topic for additional information. It contains three panes in all audit interfaces: Reports, Results,
and Group Membership.

The user being audited is identified at the top of the interface as part of the interface
breadcrumb. See the
[User Reports](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/user/overview.md)
topic for additional information.
