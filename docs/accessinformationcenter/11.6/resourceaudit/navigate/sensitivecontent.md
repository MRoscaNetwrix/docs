# Sensitive Content Audit Interface

The Sensitive Content Audit interface is opened by searching for a particular criteria value. See
the
[Search Features](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/navigate/search.md)
topic for additional information. It contains three panes in all audit interfaces: Reports, Results,
and Group Membership.

In order to enable the criteria match search feature, the **Store discovered sensitive data** option
must be enabled in the Enterprise Auditor data collector scanning the target environment. See the
relevant solution topic in the
[Netwrix Enterprise AuditorÂ Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer)
for additional information on the data collection options.

The criterion being audited is identified at the top of the interface as part of the interface
breadcrumb. See the
[Sensitive Content Reports](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resourceaudit/sensitivecontent/overview.md)
topic for additional information.
