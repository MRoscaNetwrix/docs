# Active Directory Reports

Active Directory reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the Active
Directory resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired
resource. The data within these reports is collected by the Enterprise Auditor .Active Directory
Inventory solution and the Enterprise Auditor Active Directory Permissions Analyzer solution. See
the .Active Directory Inventory Solution and the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution
topics in the
[Netwrix Enterprise AuditorÂ Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer)
for additional information.

Active Directory resource reports identify the following information in the targeted Active
Directory environment:

- How many objects exist across the targeted Active Directory domains
- What changes have been made to users and groups
- What permissions are applied to computers, groups, organizational units, domains, containers, and
  user objects in Active Directory

The following reports are available at the **Active Directory** node:

- [Domain Summary Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/activedirectory/domainsummary.md)
- [Exceptions Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/activedirectory/exceptions.md)
