# SQL Server Reports

SQL Server reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the SQL Server
resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The
data within these reports is collected by the Enterprise Auditor SQL solution. See the SQL Solution
topic in the
[Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/enterpriseauditor)
for additional information.

A single SQL Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its own
node in the Access Information Center. SQL Server reports fall into the following categories:

- Permissions reports
- Activity reports
- Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the **SQL Server** node:

- [Sensitive Content Summary Report](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/sql/sensitivecontentsummary.md)
