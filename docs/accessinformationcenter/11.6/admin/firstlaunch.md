The Access Information Center is installed with a Builtin Administrator account. Use the following
login credential for the first launch:

The new password must be eight or more characters long. After setting the password, you will need to
login with the Builtin Administrator account.

Using the Configuration interface, the Builtin Administrator account can be disabled once a domain
account has been granted the Administrator role. You can also change the password for the Builtin
Administrator account. See the
[Modify the Builtin Administrator Account](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/admin/configuration/consoleaccess.md#modify-the-builtin-administrator-account)
topic for additional information.
