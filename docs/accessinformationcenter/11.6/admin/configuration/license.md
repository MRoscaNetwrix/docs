# License Page

Access to specific types of reports and workflows is controlled through the Access Information
Center license, which is also the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor license key. The details of your
current license can be viewed on the License page of the Configuration interface. Enabling
additional features would require an updated license key, which can be discussed with your Netwrix
Account Representative. If the features displayed in this tab do not reflect the features actually
licensed, contact [Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html). See the
[Upload License](#upload-license) topic for information on updating the license key.

  Requests workflow.
