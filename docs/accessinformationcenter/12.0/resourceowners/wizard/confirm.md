**Step 2 –** On the Select Owners page, you can optionally remove owners you do not want or need
ownership confirmation from. Select those owners and click **Remove**. Those owners will not receive
the confirmation email. Once the list is set as desired, click **Finish**. The Access Information
Center begins to send the confirmation email. The table provides the following information:

- Resource Name — The icon indicates the type of resource. The resource name includes its location,
  such as the UNC path for a file system resource, the URL for SharePoint resource, or Group name
  (e.g., [Domain]\[Group]).
- Owner Name — Name of the assigned owner
- Confirmed — Indicates whether or not the assigned owner has confirmed ownership of that resource.
  Tool-tips display when hovering over the icons indicating whether the resource ownership has been
  confirmed, declined, pending response, or that a confirmation has not been requested.

**Step 3 –** The action status displays on the page. When the owner confirmation notification has
completed (100%), click Close. The Confirm Ownership wizard closes.

The selected owners receive an email from the Access Information Center asking if they are the owner
of the assigned resource. See the
[Owner Confirmation Request Email](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/resourceowners/email/confirmationrequest.md) topic for additional
information.
