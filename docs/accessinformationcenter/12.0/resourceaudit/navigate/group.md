# Group Audit Interface

The Group Audit interface is opened by searching for a particular Active Directory or Entra ID
group. See the [Search Features](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/resourceaudit/navigate/search.md) topic for additional information. It contains three
panes in all audit interfaces: Reports, Results, and Group Membership.

The group being audited is identified at the top of the interface as part of the interface
breadcrumb. See the [Group Reports](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/resourceaudit/group/overview.md) topic for additional information.
