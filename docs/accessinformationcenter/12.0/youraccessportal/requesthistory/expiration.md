# Access Expiration Email

If only temporary access was granted, once the date expires, the user will be automatically removed
from the resource, and will receive an email notification informing them of the removal.

On the [Request History Page](/docs/accessinformationcenter/12.0/youraccessportal/requesthistory/requesthistory.md) of the Your Access portal, you
can see that the icon in the Expired column has changed and it's tooltip indicates that the access
has expired.
