Review the list of resources. Items can be listed for multiple reasons:

- Resources that do not exist in the resource owners list
- Resources that exist in the resources owners list but the ownership has been declined
- Resources that are not valid selections for the selected review type

    - Membership – Resources that are not groups
    - Access / Permissions / Sensitive Data – Resources that are not file system, SharePoint, or DFS

- For Sensitive Data reviews, resources that do not have scan data available. This includes
  resources that only have sensitive data at a child folder level.

Click **OK** to close the window and complete the import of any valid resources.
