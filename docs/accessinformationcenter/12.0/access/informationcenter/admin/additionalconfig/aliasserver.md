# Alias Server Host Name

The Access Information Center can be accessed through a supported browser from a machine within your
company's network. The URL is the hosting machine's name and the
port, http://[HOSTNAME.DOMAIN.COM]:81. For example, if the application was installed on a server
named NEWYORKSRV10.NWXTech.com with the default port of 81, the URL would be
http://NEWYORKSRV10.NWXTech.com:81. This URL is supplied as the hyperlinks within the body of
Notification emails. It can be customized by supplying an alias server host name.

The Response Server Host Name parameter can be modified in the
`AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.config` file, which is located in the Access Information Center
installation directory:

…\STEALTHbits\Access Information Center

Follow the steps to supply an alias server host name for notification hyperlinks.

**Step 1 –** Open the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.config` file in a text editor, for
example Notepad.

**Step 2 –** Locate the `ResponseServerHostName` parameter. By default, the value is blank. If left
blank, the default URL is used in notifications. Edit this parameter value by adding an alias server
host name between the double quote marks. For example, the parameter would look like this if the
desired alias server host name is `AccessInformation.NWXTech.com`:

```
<add key="ResponseServerHostName" value="AccessInformation.NWXTech.com" />
```

**Step 3 –** Save and close the `AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.config` file.

Notification hyperlinks now use the supplied alias server host name.
