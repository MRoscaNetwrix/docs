# User Audit Interface

The User Audit interface is opened by searching for a particular Active Directory or Entra ID user.
See the [Search Features](search.md) topic for additional information. It contains three panes in
all audit interfaces: Reports, Results, and Group Membership.

The user being audited is identified at the top of the interface as part of the interface
breadcrumb. See the [User Reports](../user/overview.md) topic for additional information.
