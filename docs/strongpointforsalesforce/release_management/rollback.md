# Rollback

When deploying changes in a single Salesforce environment, you may find instances where you need to
rollback to a previous state after a deployment. Platform Governance for Salesforce's rollback tool
gives you the flexibility of rolling back all or selected components of your deployment,enabling you
to take action on a specific problem. There are two steps:

> Create the Rollback Record
>
> Execute and Validate the Rollback

## Create the Rollback Record

The Deployment Record status must be **Completed** to be eligible for Rollback.

1. Open the Deployment Record to rollback. To locate the record, click **Change Requests** and
   change the view to **Deployments**.
2. Click **Rollback**

3. Click **Test Connection** to ensure your credentials are working. If your credentials are not
   correct, you can click on **Save Credentials** and edit.

4. By default, all of the customizations are selected for rollback. Deselect any customizations to
   keep. The **Rollback Type** specifies the effect of the rollback:

    - **Delete**: If a customization was created during the deployment, it is deleted during the
      rollback.
    - **Override**: If a customization existed in the target environment and was changed during
      deployment, it is reset to the previous version.

5. Click **Rollback Selected Customizations**. The **Rollback Confirmation** is displayed.

## Execute and Validate the Rollback

The Rollback Record must be approved before it can be executed.

   **Deployments**.
2. Click **Test Connection** to ensure your credentials are working.
3. Click **Execute Rollback**. A Confirmation is displayed. Click **Yes** to continue.
