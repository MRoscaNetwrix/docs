# Deployments

Your deployments can be documented across your test environment(s) to your production
environment(s). Each step in the deployment process complies with your policies and a comprehensive
approval process. Deployments are blocked if approvals are not complete. A full audit trail of the
entire deployment process is maintained.The process is:

    This creates a package to:

    - **Check Dependencies**: Use to check what has been referenced.
    - **Validate Customizations**: Use to check the deployment is going to work. It simulates your
      deployment.
    - **Deploy Retrieved Customizations**: Use to deploy your customizations when you are ready to
      proceed.

4. Check your dependencies and validate your customizations.
5. Click **Deploy Retrieved Customizations** to start the deployment. This may take some time, since
   it runs the test cases into the target environment.

## Complete the Process

When the deployment process is finished:

1. Check the [Deployment Logs](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/release_management/deployment_logs.md).
2. Fix any errors and repeat the deployment if needed.
3. Once the deployment is successful, open the change request and set the status to **Completed**.
