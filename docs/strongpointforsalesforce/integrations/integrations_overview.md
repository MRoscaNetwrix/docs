Platform Governance for Salesforce provides integrations with external ticketing systems to improve workflows for customers using both. This brings all the benefits of Platform Governance for Salesforce to your external ticketing systems, including the impact analysis, release management and change reconciliation features.

## Jira

Platform Governance for Salesforceâ€™s Change Management capabilities are integrated with Jira, one of the most popular issue ticketing and development project management systems. Customers are able to push Jira change tickets into a Change Request, enabling easy management of changes directly in their system, seamless tracking of compliant changes and automating the reconciliation of change logs during an audit. This provides the following benefits to your users:

- Improved team productivity by automatically detecting objects mentioned in Jira tickets, managing changes to those objects with Change Management, and synchronizing approvals.
- The ability for auditors to track compliant changes and avoid manually reconciling change tickets to change logs during audit.
