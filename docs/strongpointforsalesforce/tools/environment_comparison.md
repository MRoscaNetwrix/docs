# Environment Comparison

Administrators use this tool to compare environments and generate an Excel report file with the results. This report can be used to troubleshoot processes or data causing errors in a particular account, compare preferences between accounts, or determine if data needs to migrate between accounts. An [Environment Compare Log](../reports/deployment_logs_environment_compare.md) is generated. The comparison can handle up to 10,000 items. You receive an email with a link to the [Export Object Attachment](export_object_attachment_records.md) record, where you can download your file. Here is the basic process:
