# Export Objects

Administrators can use this to export one or more objects, including all child objects, into a single view for easy review and management. For each export, you select the settings and optional profiles and permission sets to include in the object details. The export is done in the background to avoid timing out or exceeding the Salesforce Governor Limits. You will receive an email with a link to the [Export Object Attachment](export_object_attachment_records.md) record, where you can download your file. You can also use the __Download Files__ link on this page or on the Netwrix Dashboard to download your file.

Platform Governance for Salesforce stores Object-level permissions in a Custom Object. There are two reports (__Netwrix Dashboard__ > __Reports__ > __Access Reports__) for easy access to this information:

> __Permissions by Object__
>
> __Object Permissions by Profile/PermSet__

Open __Netwrix Dashboard__ > __Tools__ > __Export Objects__  
__Objects__ is the default tab.
