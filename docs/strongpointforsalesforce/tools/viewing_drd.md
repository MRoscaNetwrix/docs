# Dependency Relationship Diagram

Platform Governance for Salesforce's Dependency Relationship Diagram (DRD) displays objects, customizations and their relationships and dependencies including scripts, reports and workflows in a graphical diagram.

To use the entity diagram:

1. Open __Netwrix Dashboard__ > __Tools__ > __Dependency Relationship Diagram__
2. Select the object to view.
3. The diagram displays the object and customizations under it. Use __Show/Hide Standard Fields__ to toggle the display of Standard Fields for easier searching of non-standard fields.
4. Click on any item to expand the graphical representation of objects, dependencies and associated relationships. If there are more than 10 entries, a __Next__ option is available at the end to expand the results. __Next__ loads the next 10 entries, __Back__ loads the previous list.
5. Click __Open Record__ to open the customization record for the item.
