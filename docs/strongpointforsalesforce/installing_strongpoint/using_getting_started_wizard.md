# Run the Getting Started Wizard

The Getting Started Wizard helps you set up Platform Governance for Salesforce after you have done the [basic installation](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/installing_strongpoint/installing_strongpoint.md) and configuration.

To use the Getting Started Wizard:

1. Open __Netwrix Dashboard__.
2. Open __Settings__> __Getting Started Wizard__

The __Getting Started Wizard__ opens to help you finish the configuration and set up.

## Choose Your License Type

On the Initial Setup Wizard page, choose the package type you have purchased. If you have an Intelligent Change Management or Enterprise Compliance License, enter the __Input Authorization Token__ sent to you. Click __Next__.

## Add your Credentials

Once you have chosen your license type, you need to add your credentials. If your credentials change, an alert is sent to update the saved credentials. Expired credentials can cause auto scanners to fail. Use __Netwrix Dashboard__ > __Settings__> __SPÂ Credentials__ to update your credentials.
