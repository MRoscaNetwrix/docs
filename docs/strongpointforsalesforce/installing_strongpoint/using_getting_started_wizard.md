# Run the Getting Started Wizard

The Getting Started Wizard helps you set up Platform Governance for Salesforce after you have done
the [basic installation](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/installing_strongpoint/installing_strongpoint.md) and configuration.

To use the Getting Started Wizard:

1. Open **Netwrix Dashboard**.
2. Open **Settings**> **Getting Started Wizard**

The **Getting Started Wizard** opens to help you finish the configuration and set up.

## Choose Your License Type

On the Initial Setup Wizard page, choose the package type you have purchased. If you have an
Intelligent Change Management or Enterprise Compliance License, enter the **Input Authorization
Token** sent to you. Click **Next**.

## Add your Credentials

Once you have chosen your license type, you need to add your credentials. If your credentials
change, an alert is sent to update the saved credentials. Expired credentials can cause auto
scanners to fail. Use **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Settings**> **SPÂ Credentials** to update your
credentials.
