# Scanner Overview

The Scanner menu is located on the Netwrix Dashboard page.

- [Scheduler](scheduler.md) schedules automatic scans.
- [Manual Scanners](../installing_strongpoint/running_scanner.md) accesses the list of scanners where you can select one or more to run. __Manual Scanners__ can also be run from __Netwrix Dashboard__.
- [Daily Scan Configuration](daily_scan.md) enables an administrator to select object types for daily scanning, instead of defaulting to all types.
- [Field Level Security Scanner](field_level_scanner.md) displays all fields using the selected Salesforce object.
