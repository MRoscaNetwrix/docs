# Field Level Security Scanner

The Field Level Security Scanner creates a comprehensive list of Customizations, Field APIÂ Name, Parent Object, Package, and Salesforce Type for a selected Object.

Run the scanners before you search to ensure you have the latest data.

1. Open __Netwrix Dashboard__ > __Scanner__ > Field-Level Security Scanner.

   __NOTE:__  It is not technically possible to scan permissions on all fields in each object.
