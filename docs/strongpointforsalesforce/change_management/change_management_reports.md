# Change Enablement Reports

Platform Governance for Salesforce has many different reports you can use to view your changes, these include: Compliant, Open Non-Compliant and What Changed Reports.

The __Compliant Changes__ and __Unresolved Non-Compliant__ reports are the primary reports for managing changes in your system. They display all changes in the system that are compliant and those that are not compliant. An additional report called __What Changed?__ shows all changes that have happened.

To access the Change Reports:

Open __Netwrix Dashboard__ > __Reports__ > __Change Enablement__ and select one of the reports:

> __Approval Override__: shows all changes approved with an approval override.
>
> __What Changed?__: shows all changes that have occurred.
>
> __Unresolved Non-Compliant Changes__: displays open non-compliant changes. A non-compliant change indicates something was changed without the required approvals. By looking at this report, you can investigate changes and get an understanding of what the impacts are and see if any additional changes need to be made. This report is used to track changes that require action.
>
> __Managed Package Updates__: displays managed package update details for auditing.
>
> __Resolved Non-Compliant Changes__: displays resolved non-compliant changes with the change overview and the difference summary.
>
> __Compliant Changes__: displays all compliant changes. Compliant changes are automatically marked as closed. This report is used to review changes that have been automatically cleared.
>
> __Consolidated Change By Type__: displays changes summarized and grouped by Salesforce Type.
>
> __Deployed Changes__: displays an end to end summary of deployed changes to enable tracking and reporting of changes to the system.
>
> __Data Tracking Change Logs__: displays changes on objects set for data tracking.
>
> __Change/Approval Policy Changes__: this report is based on Field History Tracking. You can track up to 20 fields from the Policy Record. Salesforce starts tracking field history from the date and time you turn it on a field.
>
> __Fast Scan for Permissions Changes__: displays all changes detected in PermissionSet, PermissionSetGroup, and Profiles by the Fast Scan.
