A noncompliant change means something got changed without the required approvals. Open each change log to investigate the change. You can retroactively attach a change request to a noncompliant change and get the necessary approvals for the change to be compliant.

1. Create a New [Change Request](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/change_management/creating_change_request.md) or open an existing one.
2. Set it to Pending Approval.
3. Once it is approved and complete, set the __Status__ of the Change Request to __Complete__.
4. Click on the Change Log namet to open it.
5. Enter the __Related Change Request__.
6. Enter the __Resolution Description__.
7. Once all changes are made, select __Closed__ for the Status.
8. Save the __Change Log__.
