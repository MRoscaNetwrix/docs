# Creating a Change Request

Change requests are the method to plan, analyze, track and approve changes. You can create different types of Change Requests to match the change you want to manage. Here are two options:

- __Customization__ Change request is used for Metadata changes, such as [Customizations](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/customizations/customizations_overview.md).
- __Data Record__ - Change request is used for Data Changes to Revenue Cloud/ [CPQ](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/change_management/enhanced_cpq_support.md).

Data Record Change Requests are only available with an Enterprise Compliance license.

1. Open the __Change Requests__ tab.
2. Click __New__

3. Enter information as needed.

   - __Change Request Name__: add a meaningful name to the change request.
   - __Change Request Type__: Customizations for metadata changes and Data Records for data.
   - __Parent Change Request__: enter an optional parent change request if this is part of a bigger change.
   - __Change Overview__: add a summary of the desired changes.

## Preparing the Change Request for Approval

Review the change request:

- [Run Impact Analysis](#Run-Impact-Analysis)
- [View the DRD](#View-the-DRD)

5. Click __Submit for Approval__ to start the process. Approval notifications are sent to the approvers.

If you created the Change Request in your sandbox to determine the scope of the change, recreate it in your Production environment to enable approvals and ongoing tracking.   
For new objects that do not yet exist in Production, edit the Change Request and enter the full API Names of these objects into the Proposed Customization fields in the Scope Section. You can add multiple API Names by using the Add button. Save the Change Request when complete.
