# Change Management Overview

Platform Governance for Salesforce Closed Loop Change Management and Compliance is an enhanced
change management system for changes to Salesforce accounts using the Platform Governance for
Salesforce automated documentation and change management system.

Platform Governance for Salesforce extends your current change management system to enable you to:

- Establish change management policies for different types of objects and processes.
- Route changes for approval within Salesforce.
- Authenticate that changes to the system are in accordance with applicable policies.
- Detect and resolve non-compliant changes.
- Manage deployments and sandbox refreshing using best practices.

## Plan, Approve and Deploy Changes

### Plan with a Change Request

Change Requests are used to plan and track changes to the system.

They allow for common actions associated with change requests including:

- Grouping process issues.
- Planning completion targets.
- Tracking the status.
- Managing approvals.

The **Advanced Change Management** Module provides additional functionality:

- Automatically define the change level required for compliance based on the appropriate
  [Change and Approval Policy](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/change_management/change_and_approval_policy.md).
- Identify impacts on other customizations.
- Attach and manage test scripts.
- Manage and record Pre and Post-Deployment
  [Environment Comparisons](/docs/strongpointforsalesforce/tools/environment_comparison.md).
- Archive fields.
- Delete customizations.

Change Management can be integrated with other change tracking systems using the External Change
Request Number field. It is beneficial to use the change records since they can be linked to
processes, customizations and clean up activities.

### Confirm with a Deployment Record

When tracking Full Software Development Lifecycle changes, the Deployment Record enables you to
track deployment approvals. Once a Change Request is approved, this documents a change is ready for
development. At this point, a new change request with the Stage Deployment Record can be created and
tracked.

This enables:

- Tracking of deployment activities.
- Documentation of approvals for deployment to document that any changes that occurred during
  development have been approved and that the appropriate pre-deployment checks have been completed.

This record is linked to the original change request to enable end to end reporting of the change.
