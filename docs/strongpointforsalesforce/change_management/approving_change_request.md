# Approving a Change Request

Approvers are populated from the Change/Approval Policy for the Change Request. Approval notifications are sent when the Change Request owner advances the status to __Pending Approval__.

1. Approver receives an email with a link to the Change Request.
2. When the Change Request opens, __Approve__ and __Reject__ buttons are available at the top of the form:

   - If all approvers approve the Change Request, the status is changed to __Approved__. Implement the changes specified by the Change Request.
   - If an approver rejects the Change Request, the status is changed to __Rejected__. You can return the Change Request to __In Progress__, edit it, and reset it to __Pending Approval__ if there are errors or omissions.
3. Change Request owner [Completes and Validates the Change Request](completing_change_request.md).

Once the Change Request is approved, you cannot change the customizations attached to the Change Request.

You can add the __Strongpoint CR Approval Override__ Permission Set to specific users. Users with this Permission Set can approve a Change Request independent of the governing policy. The default approve permission is no longer included with the System Administrator role. If you have a System Administrator or other user you want to be able to approve, assign the __Strongpoint CR Approval Override__ Permission Set.
