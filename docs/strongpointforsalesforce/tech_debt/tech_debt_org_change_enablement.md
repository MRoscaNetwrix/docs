# Change Enablement

It is commonly believed doing things faster is more dangerous, and doing things slowly and carefully is safer. In today’s world, slower is simply not an option. Platform Governance for Salesforce realized that __Faster__ can also be __Safer__ and sometimes __Very Fast__ can be __Extremely Safe__.

In [Change Monitoring](/docs/product_docs/strongpointforsalesforce/tech_debt/tech_debt_change_monitoring.md), we discussed setting up automated change monitoring to deliver instant oversight of your org. [Org Clean Up](/docs/product_docs/strongpointforsalesforce/tech_debt/tech_debt_org_clean_up.md) described ongoing monitoring of specific changes. Automated Risk Management takes these disciplines and combines them with three goals:

1. __Keep your org safe__ — continuous, comprehensive monitoring of all changes
2. __Make your team more efficient__ — distribute work based on risk and automate key process steps to ensure speed and reliability
3. __Delight your key stakeholders__ — provide rapid access to the changes they need to drive the business forward

Our flagship __Intelligent Change Enablement__ processes automate the required steps to make changes quickly and safely, clean up technical debt and make your orgs more understandable and efficient.

The key steps:

1. __Review and Finalize Your Policies__ to support a rapid change process.
2. __Train Your Team__ to use our automated tools.
3. __Document Your New, Faster Proces__s based on industry best practices or tailored to your existing Jira or ServiceNow process.
4. __Roll Out the New Process__ in production.
