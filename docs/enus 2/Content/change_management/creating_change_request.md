# Creating a Change Request

Change requests are the method to plan, analyze, track and approve changes. You can create different types of Change Requests to match the change you want to manage. Here are two options:

* **Customization** Change request is used for Metadata changes, such as [Customizations](../customizations/customizations_overview "Open the Customizations Overview topic").
* **Data Record** - Change request is used for Data Changes to Revenue Cloud/ [CPQ](enhanced_CPQ_support "Open Enhanced CPQ Support topic").

:::note
Data Record Change Requests are only available with an Enterprise Compliance license.
:::

1. Open the **Change Requests** tab.
2. Click **New**

   * **Change Request Name**: add a meaningful name to the change request.
   * **Change Request Type**: Customizations for metadata changes and Data Records for data.
   * **Parent Change Request**: enter an optional parent change request if this is part of a bigger change.
   * **Change Overview**: add a summary of the desired changes.
   * **Change Type**: select the type from the list. **Minor** is the default.
   * **Is Release**: check if this change request represents a release. The customizations from all the child change requests are rolled into this release for deployment.

:::note
If you created the Change Request in your sandbox to determine the scope of the change, recreate it in your Production environment to enable approvals and ongoing tracking. For new objects that do not yet exist in Production, edit the Change Request and enter the full API Names of these objects into the Proposed Customization fields in the Scope Section. You can add multiple API Names by using the Add button. Save the Change Request when complete.
