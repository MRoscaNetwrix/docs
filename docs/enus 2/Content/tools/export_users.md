# Export Users

Exports user information to an XLS file.

Administrators can use this tool to export all user information into a single view for easy review and management. The export is done in the background to avoid timing out or exceeding the Salesforce Governor Limits. You receive an email with a link to the [Export Object Attachment](export_object_attachment_records "Open Export Object Attachment record") record, where you can download your file.
