# Export Objects

Administrators can use this to export one or more objects, including all child objects, into a single view for easy review and management. For each export, you select the settings and optional profiles and permission sets to include in the object details. The export is done in the background to avoid timing out or exceeding the Salesforce Governor Limits. You will receive an email with a link to the [Export Object Attachment](export_object_attachment_records "Open Export Object Attachment record") record, where you can download your file. You can also use the **Download Files** link on this page or on the Netwrix Dashboard to download your file.

:::note
Platform Governance for Salesforce stores Object-level permissions in a Custom Object. There are two reports (Netwrix Dashboard > Reports > Access Reports) for easy access to this information:
:::

> **Permissions by Object**
>
> **Object Permissions by Profile/PermSet**

Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Tools** > **Export Objects**  
**Objects** is the default tab.
