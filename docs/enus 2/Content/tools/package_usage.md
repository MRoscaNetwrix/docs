# Package Usage

The Package Usage tool provides administrators real-time insights into the usage and allocation of additional product licenses across the organization. This tool enables them to identify potential cost savings. Used in conjunction with the existing [User Activity](user_activity "User Activity") tool, it provides a comprehensive overview of who is accessing the environment and for what purpose.

The Package Usage tool is available with the Intelligent Change Enablement and Enterprise Compliance [licenses](../installing_strongpoint/features_by_license_type "Review the Strongpoint licenses").
