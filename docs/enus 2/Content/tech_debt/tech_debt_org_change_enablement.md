# Change Enablement

It is commonly believed doing things faster is more dangerous, and doing things slowly and carefully is safer. In today’s world, slower is simply not an option. Platform Governance for Salesforce realized that **Faster** can also be **Safer** and sometimes **Very Fast** can be **Extremely Safe**.

In [Change Monitoring](tech_debt_change_monitoring "Open Change Monitoring topic"), we discussed setting up automated change monitoring to deliver instant oversight of your org. [Org Clean Up](tech_debt_org_clean_up "Open Org Clean Up topic") described ongoing monitoring of specific changes. Automated Risk Management takes these disciplines and combines them with three goals:

1. **Keep your org safe** — continuous, comprehensive monitoring of all changes
2. **Make your team more efficient** — distribute work based on risk and automate key process steps to ensure speed and reliability
3. **Delight your key stakeholders** — provide rapid access to the changes they need to drive the business forward

Our flagship **Intelligent Change Enablement** processes automate the required steps to make changes quickly and safely, clean up technical debt and make your orgs more understandable and efficient.

The key steps:

1. **Review and Finalize Your Policies** to support a rapid change process.
2. **Train Your Team** to use our automated tools.
3. **Document Your New, Faster Proces**s based on industry best practices or tailored to your existing Jira or ServiceNow process.
4. **Roll Out the New Process** in production.
