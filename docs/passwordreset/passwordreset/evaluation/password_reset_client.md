The Password Reset Client does not modify any Windows system files.

The Password Reset Client is normally deployed with Group Policy, Microsoft System Center
Configuration Manager, or some other software deployment tool. It takes about 15 minutes to set up
an automated deployment, so we will install the PRC manually for the evaluation.

## Installing the PRC

Follow the steps below to install the PRC.

**Step 1 –** Click **Start** > **Netwrix Password Reset** > **Client Software**.

**Step 2 –** Double-click **NPRClt330.msi**.

**Step 3 –** Click **Next**.

**Step 4 –** Read the license agreement. Click **I accept the license agreement**. Click **Next** if
you accept all the terms.

**Step 5 –** Click **Next**.

**Step 6 –** Once the Password Reset Client is installed, click **Finish**.

**Step 7 –** Click **Yes** is asked to restart the computer.

You can also install the Password Reset Client on any client computers that are being used for the
evaluation.

## Configuring the PRC

The Password Reset Client is normally configured with an Active Directory administrative template.
This allows you to centrally configure all computers in the domain. It takes about 15 minutes to set
up the Administrative Template, so we will configure the PRC by importing the settings into the
registry for the evaluation.

**Step 1 –** Download the sample configuration from the following link:
[https://www.netwrix.com/download/PRC_Config.zip](https://www.netwrix.com/download/PRC_Config.zip)

**Step 2 –** Extract **PRC_Config.reg** from the .zip file.

**Step 3 –** Right-click **PRC_Config.reg**, then click **Edit**.

**Step 4 –** Replace **127.0.0.1** in the .reg file with the IP address or hostname of your
evaluation server.

**NOTE:** If you are only testing the Password Reset Client on the evaluation server, then leave it
set to 127.0.0.1. The IP address appears on two lines. You must change both lines.

**Step 5 –** Press **CTRL** + **S** to save your changes, then close **Notepad**.

**Step 6 –** Double-click **PRC_Config** to import the settings into the registry. Click **Yes**
when asked to confirm. Repeat this step on any client computers being used for the evaluation.

**NOTE:** You must import the configuration settings into the registry whenever you edit
PRC_Config.reg, otherwise the old settings will remain.

## Using the PRC

You can access the Password Reset Client from the Windows Logon and Unlock Computer screens. Click
the **Reset password...** command link to display the Password Reset menu.
