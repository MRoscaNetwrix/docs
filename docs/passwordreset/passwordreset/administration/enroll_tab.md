### Options

Password Reset can send e-mail alerts to users when a request is submitted for their account. These alerts can be sent to the user's Active Directory e-mail address and/or to an e-mail address in Password Reset's database. Select the __Users must enter an e-mail address to enroll__ check box if users should enter an e-mail address during enrollment.

The number of questions that users must answer to enroll is configurable, and is set to three by default. Select the desired number of questions from the __Users must answer...__ drop-down list.

You can also set a minimum length for each answer. Only alphanumeric characters are counted because Password Reset only checks alphanumeric characters. Select the minimum number of alphanumeric characters in each answer from the __Answers must contain at least...__ drop-down list.
