# Evaluation

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer is an advanced password filter for Windows. This Evaluator's Guide
shows you how to quickly install, configure, and test Password Policy Enforcer. Password Policy
Enforcer helps you to secure your network by ensuring that users choose strong passwords. If a user
chooses a password that does not comply with the password policy, Password Policy Enforcer
immediately rejects the password and tells the user why their password was rejected.

Unlike password cracking products that check passwords after they are accepted by the operating
system, Password Policy Enforcer checks new passwords immediately to ensure that weak passwords do
not jeopardize system security.

**NOTE:** You can also use Password Policy Enforcer to ensure that passwords are compatible with
other systems, and to synchronize passwords with other systems and applications.
