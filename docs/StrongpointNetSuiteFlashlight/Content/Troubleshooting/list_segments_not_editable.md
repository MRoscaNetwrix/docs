# List Segments Field Cannot be Edited

When setting the Number of Rows in List segments, sometimes the field cannot be edited.

To resolve this:

1. Open **Setup**
2. Select **Company**.
3. Select **General Preferences**.
4. Set the **Number of Rows in List Segments** to 1000.

If the field is still gray:

1. Scroll down the page to the tab **Overriding Preferences**
2. Check the box for Number of Rows in List Segments.
