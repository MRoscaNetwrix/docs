# Using the Strongpoint SQL Library

The SQL Library is a powerful tool to help you locate formulas used across the Saved Searches in your account. An example is to locate a formula to reuse it in another search.

To access the SQL Library:

Open **Flashlight** > **Tools** > **SQL Library**

This report displays a list of all formulas used in Saved Searches. The report contains the following information:

* **Internal ID**: internal id of the Saved Search.
* **Name**: name of the Saved Search.
* **Parent**: parent of the Saved Search (for example, ScheduleScripts, Workflows, ClientScripts).
* **Search Formulas**: all formulas from the Saved Search criteria and results.
* **Go To Record**: link to the specific Saved Search record.
