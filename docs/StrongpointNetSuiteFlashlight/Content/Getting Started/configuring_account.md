# Configuring your Account

Before you can start documenting your system, you need to apply a configuration change to your account that updates the number of rows in list segments. The following steps describe how to accomplish this configuration:

1. Hover over the **Home** icon, and click **Set Preferences** from the drop down menu.
2. Scroll down to the **Optimizing NetSuite** section.
3. Set **Number of Rows in List Segments** to *1000*  
   If the field is grayed and cannot be edited, refer to the troubleshooting article [List Segments Field Cannot be Edited](../Troubleshooting/list_segments_not_editable).

You are now ready to use Flashlight to document your account.
