## Password Policy Enforcer v11.0

New: Redesigned UI

The user interface of the Management Console has been fully redesigned to reflect modern design
standards and account for all the feedback our customers have given us throughout the years.

New: PowerShell cmdlets

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer now includes a set of PowerShell cmdlets that enable administrators
to easily manage policy, generate reports, and check the health of Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer
from PowerShell in both interactive and automated ways.

New: Support Tools

Additional support tools have been added to allow administrators to check the health of the Netwrix
Password Policy Enforcer and audit the version of each installation from one location. This allows
customers to quickly identify any problems and keep their Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer
installation up to date.

New: Updated Installer

The Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer QuickStart Wizard has been replaced with MSI packages for
easier installation and upgrade of the client and the server.

New: Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer Web

PPE Web is now available to all licensed Password Policy Enforcer customers. PPE Web allows users to
change their Windows domain passwords from a web browser and integrates with Netwrix Password Policy
Enforcer to enforce customizable password policies and assist users in selecting compliant
passwords.

Enhancement: Updated policy templates

The out-of-the-box policy templates have been updated to reflect recent changes in different
compliance standards. Old templates will still be available, and customers' current policies will
not be changed as part of this update.
