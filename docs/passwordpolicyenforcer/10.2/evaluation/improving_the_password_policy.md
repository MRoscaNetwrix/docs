# Improving the Password Policy

Password Policy Enforcer rules have properties that control how rules are enforced. You can improve
the effectiveness of the Users policy by enabling "character substitution detection" and
"bi-directional analysis" for the User Logon Name and Dictionary rules.

When character substitution detection is enabled, Password Policy Enforcer searches passwords for
common character substitutions. For example, an S replaced with a $. If a password only complies
with the policy because of the substitution (i.e. the substitution is needed to make the password
compliant), then Password Policy Enforcer rejects the password.

Bi-directional analysis tests passwords with their characters reversed to stop users from
circumventing a rule by entering a non-compliant password backwards. For example, "drowssapym"
instead of "mypassword".

Follow the steps below to enable the character substitution detection and bi-directional analysis
properties for the User Logon Name and Dictionary rules.

**Step 1 –** Click the **Users** policy in the left pane of the management console.

**Step 2 –** Double-click the **User Logon Name** rule.

**Step 3 –** Select the **Detect Character Substitution** and **Bi-directional analysis** check
boxes, then click **OK**.

**Step 4 –** Double-click the **Dictionary Rule**.

**Step 5 –** Select the **Detect Character Substitution** and **Bi-direction analysis** check boxes,
then click **OK**.

Test the improved Users policy with passwords that were accepted under the previous policy (see the
table below). Password Policy Enforcer should reject all of them.

| Password | Result   | Reason                             |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| tseTEPP  | Rejected | Similar to user logon name         |
| kravdraA | Rejected | Similar to word in dictionary file |
| Aardv@rk | Rejected | Similar to word in dictionary file |
