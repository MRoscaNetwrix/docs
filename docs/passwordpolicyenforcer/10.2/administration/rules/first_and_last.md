# First and Last Character Rules

The First and Last Character rules reject passwords that do not begin or end with an appropriate
character. These rules are typically used to ensure password compatibility with other systems.

Select the **Enabled** check box to enable the First or Last Character rule.

Select the **begin** (First Character rule) or **end** (Last Character rule) option if you want to
specify the **acceptable** character sets.

Select the **not begin** (First Character rule) or **not end** (Last Character rule) option if you
want to specify the **unacceptable** character.

Choose one or more character sets by selecting the check boxes beside the character set names.

**NOTE:** Click the Messages tab to customize the Password Policy Client rule inserts. The First and
Last Character rules use custom character set definitions from the Character rules, even if the
Character rules are disabled.
