# Minimum Age Rule

The Minimum Age rule stops users from quickly cycling through a series of passwords in order to
evade the History and Similarity rules. This rule can only be enforced by domain policies.

Select the **Enabled** check box to enable the Minimum Age rule.

Choose a value from the **days** drop-down list to specify how many days users must wait before
changing their password.

Click the **Messages** tab to customize the Password Policy Client. Only the Reason insert is shown
because minimum age requirements are not included in the Password Policy message.

**NOTE:** The Minimum Age rule is unique because users cannot comply with it by choosing a different
password; they must wait until the required number of days has elapsed. The Password Policy Client
consequently handles rejections by this rule differently to other rules. Rather than displaying the
usual message components, the Password Policy Client only displays the Minimum Age rule's Reason
insert. See
[Password Policy Client](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/10.2/administration/passwordpolicyclient/password_policy_client.md)
topic for additional information. The Rejection Reason template, macros, and inserts from other
rules are not displayed when a password change is denied by the Minimum Age rule.

The Minimum Age rule is not enforced during policy testing, but the test log does show the user's
password age. A log entry is also added if the Minimum Age rule would have rejected the password
change. See the
[Managing Policies](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/10.2/administration/managingpolicies/managing_policies.md)
topic for additional information.
