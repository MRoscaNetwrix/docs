Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer helps you to secure your network by ensuring that users choose
strong passwords. When a user chooses a password that does not comply with the password policy,
Password Policy Enforcer immediately rejects the password and tells them why their password was
rejected.

Unlike password cracking products that check passwords after they are accepted by the operating
system, Password Policy Enforcer checks new passwords immediately to ensure that weak passwords do
not jeopardize network security.

You can also use Password Policy Enforcer to ensure that passwords are compatible with other
systems, and to synchronize passwords with other networks and applications.

**NOTE:** The
[Evaluation](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/10.2/evaluation/evaluation_overview.md)
topic contains step-by-step instructions to help you quickly install, configure, and evaluate
Password Policy Enforcer. Read the Evaluation topic if you are using Password Policy Enforcer for
the first time.
