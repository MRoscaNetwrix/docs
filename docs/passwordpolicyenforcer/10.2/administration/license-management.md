# License Generator

The License Generator tool allows users to create licenses for the Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer,
Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer Web, and Netwrix Password Reset products. Licenses can be
configured and customized based on individual security polices. Each license generated will be saved
locally as a .txt file. Use the license generated from this tool when configuring the Password
Policy Enforcer console.

## Using the License Generator

The License Generator tool installs with the default installation of Password Policy Enforcer under
the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Password Policy Enforcer\licensegenerator` folder. Once installed,
execute the AnixisLicenseTool.exe file. The LicenseGenerator folder also contains templates for
common licensing scenarios across all password policy enforcement products.

The License Generator tool has the following features:

- Product Type — This drop-down contains all password policy enforcement products under the Netwrix
  suite of products
- License Type — This drop-down contains all license categories and will determine the scope and
  permissions granted to the license. The different License types are as follows:

  - Evaluation license — This license type allows users on the server to have full evaluation
    permissions
  - Perpetual license — This license type allows users on the server to have full permissions
    indefinitely
  - Subscription license — This license type allows users on the server to have all permissions as
    granted by their subscription model

- Product Version — Lists all product versions the License Generator can create valid license for.
  This field is enabled only when selecting the Perpetual license type.
- License Period — This drop-down contains all available options for licensing. This field is
  enabled only when selecting the Evaluation and Subscription license types.
- End Date — Date on which the custom license will expire. This field is enabled only when selecting
  the Evaluation and Subscription license types.
- Licensed To — The name of the entity to receive the license
- Users count — The number of users who will be granted permissions set in the license
- Custom Data — This drop-down contains the option to classify this license as a enzoic-enabled
  license
- Generate — Press this button to generate the license and save the .txt file.
- Generate & open — Press this button to generate the license and open the .txt file. You will then
  be able to copy the entire license and import it into the Password Policy Enforcer. See the
