# Customizing Rule Inserts

Rule inserts allow the Password Policy and Rejection Reason messages to display the most appropriate
information for each user. Most Password Policy Enforcer rules have a Policy and Reason insert. The
Policy insert is used by the [POLICY] macro, and the Reason insert is used by the [REASON] macro.

Follow the steps below to edit a rule's inserts.

**Step 1 –** Click the **Policies** item to display the Policies view.

**Step 2 –** Click the **desired policy** in the right pane of the management console. In this
example it is Policy 1.

Use the \n escape sequence to start a new line in a message template or rule insert
(Password Policy Client V5.1 and later). Inserts and lines starting with two or more spaces, a

## Customizing Password Policy Client Messages

The Password Policy Client displays three messages to help users choose a password:

- The Password Policy message is shown as the user changes their password. This message explains the
  password policy to the user.
- The Rejection Reason message is shown if a password does not comply with the Password Policy
  Enforcer password policy. This message tells the user why their password was rejected.
- The Generic Rejection message is shown if Password Policy Enforcer does not have a specific reason
  for the rejection, generally because the password does not comply with the Windows password
  policy.

### Password Policy Client Message Components

Password Policy Client messages are built using templates, macros, and inserts. The image below
shows a sample policy message with the template in blue, a macro in green, and policy inserts in
white.
