# Netwrix Password Reset and Web

Netwrix Password Reset and Web allows users to securely manage their passwords from a web browser.
Both products integrate with Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer to ensure that passwords comply with
the password policy, and to help users choose compliant passwords.

Password Reset is a self-service password management system that allows users to change their
password, reset a forgotten password, and unlock their account without calling the helpdesk. It
includes the Password Reset Client, which allows users to access APR from the Windows Logon and
Unlock screens.

The [Web](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/10.2/web/web_overview.md)
application allows users to change their password from a web browser.
