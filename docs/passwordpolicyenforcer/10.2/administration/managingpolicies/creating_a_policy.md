# Creating a Policy

There are no password policies defined when Password Policy Enforcer is first installed. Password
Policy Enforcer accepts all passwords in this state, so users only need to comply with the Windows
password policy rules (if enabled).

Follow the steps to create a new password policy.

**Step 1 –** Click the **Policies** item to display the Policies view.

**Step 2 –** Click **New Policy** in the right pane of the management console.

**Step 3 –** Enter a unique policy name in the **New policy name** text box.

**Step 4 –** If the new policy should inherit its default configuration from an existing policy,
choose a policy from the **Copy settings from** drop-down list.

**Step 5 –** Optionally, if the new policy should inherit settings from commonly used frameworks,
select an Policy Template from the drop-down list. For a list of policies see
[ Policy Templates ](#policy-templates).

**Step 6 –** Click **OK**.

**Step 7 –** Modify the default policy properties as needed.

**Step 8 –** Click **OK** to close the Policy Properties page, and then configure the rules for this
policy. See the
[Assigning Policies](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/10.2/administration/managingpolicies/assigning_policies.md)
topic for additional information.
