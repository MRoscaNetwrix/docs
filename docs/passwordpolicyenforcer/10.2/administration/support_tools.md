### Create Configuration Report as Text or HTML for Auditors

As of the release of Password Policy Enforcer 10.2, there is currently no way to export reports.
However, you can export Password Policy Enforcer's domain configuration with the following command:

ldifde -f PPE10.1.txt -d "CN=Password Policy Enforcer 10.0,CN=System,DC=netwrix,DC=net" -l
url,wWWHomePage

You will need to change the new domain name to match your domain. Your user, group, and OU
assignments will not be valid in the new domain, so they will need to be updated after the import in
the new domain. This is easily done after the import from the PPE Management Console in the Policy
Properties page for each policy. See the
[Assigning Policies](/docs/passwordpolicyenforcer/10.2/administration/assigning_policies.md)
topic for additional information. Your license will also most likely need to be imported into the
new domain. This is done from the About tab on the PPS Properties page.

Follow the steps below to edit the edit the PPE10.1.txt file .

**Step 1 –** Open the **PPE10.1.txt** file in a text editor.

**Step 2 –** Replace **changetype: add** with **changetype: modify**

**Step 3 –** Add the line **replace: wWWHomePage** above the line starting with **wWWHomePage:**

**Step 4 –** Add a line with just a "**-**" (hyphen) character below the line starting with
**wWWHomePage:**

**Step 5 –** Add the line **replace: url** above the line starting with **url::**

**Step 6 –** Add a "**-**" hyphen near the end of the file, below the last line in the URL attribute

**Step 7 –** Open ADSIEdit or AD Users and Computers in the target domain and clear the **URL** and
**www wWWHomePage** attributes for the Password Policy Enforcer configuration object (CN=Password
Policy Enforcer 10.0,CN=System).

**Step 8 –** Import configuration with the following command:

ldifde -i -f PPE10.1.txt

Check **URL** and **wWWHomePage** attributes in ADSIEdit or AD Users and Computers before opening
PPE Management Console to ensure that configuration has been maintained.
