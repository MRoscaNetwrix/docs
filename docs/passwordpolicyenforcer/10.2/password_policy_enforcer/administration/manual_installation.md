# Manual Installation (Express Setup)

Manual installation is recommended for small to medium networks. You need to repeat the installation
procedure below on every computer that should enforce the password policy. To install Password
Policy Enforcer onto a computer:

**Step 1 –** Start the Password Policy Enforcer installer (PPE10.2.exe).

**Step 2 –** Read the license agreement, and then click **Yes** if you accept all the license terms
and conditions.

**Step 3 –** Select the Express option, and then click **Next**.

**Step 4 –** Select the **Password Policy Server** check box if it is not selected.

**Step 5 –** Click **Next** to install Password Policy Enforcer.

**Step 6 –** Click **Yes** when asked to restart the computer.

Password Policy Enforcer has its own password rules, so you may want to disable the Windows password
policy rules before configuring Password Policy Enforcer. See the
[Disable Windows Rules](/versioned_docs/passwordpolicyenforcer_10.2/password_policy_enforcer/administration/disable_windows_rules.md)
topic for additional information.
