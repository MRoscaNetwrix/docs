### Options

Password Reset can send e-mail alerts to users when a request is submitted for their account. These
alerts can be sent to the user's Active Directory e-mail address and/or to an e-mail address in
Password Reset's database. Select the **Users must enter an e-mail address to enroll** check box if
users should enter an e-mail address during enrollment.

The number of questions that users must answer to enroll is configurable, and is set to three by
default. Select the desired number of questions from the **Users must answer...** drop-down list.

You can also set a minimum length for each answer. Only alphanumeric characters are counted because
Password Reset only checks alphanumeric characters. Select the minimum number of alphanumeric
characters in each answer from the **Answers must contain at least...** drop-down list.
