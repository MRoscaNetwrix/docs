These are dependent upon the total number of Active Directory objects.

Additional Server Requirements

* The Recovery for Active Directory installer checks if .Net 8.06 is installed on the machine. If not, it is installed as part of the Recovery Application Server installation process.
* Install the `msoledbsql.msi` to enable the application server to connect to the SQL Server prior to starting installation

  **NOTE:** The latest `msoledbsql.msi` can be obtained from Microsoft's website. Netwrix does not redistribute this file.

The following permission is required to install the application:

* SQL Server permissions – Domain account needs to be granted SQL Server permissions.
* Recovery Configuration Utility – Must have Domain Admin rights to use all options in this utility

## Virtual Environment Recommendations

While physical machines are always preferred, we fully support the use of virtual machines. Microsoft® Hyper-V® and VMWare® ESX®/ESXi™ are supported hyper visors.
