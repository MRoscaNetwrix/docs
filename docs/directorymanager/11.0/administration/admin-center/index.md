## Enroll with Authentication Types

When the administrator has enabled multifactor authentication and second factor authentication for
an identity store, users must enroll their identity store accounts in GroupID. Without enrolling,
they will not be able to sign into GroupID.

To enroll, a user must register his or her identity store account in GroupID using one or more
authentication types. When a user enrolls for multifactor authentication, it also suffices for
second factor authentication, and vice versa. See the
[Authentication Policy](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/configuration/identity-stores/active-directory.md)
topic for a list of supported authentication types.

Account enrollment is a one-time process. Enrolled users must authenticate their identity store
accounts every time they have to pass multifactor or second factor authentication.

- For second factor authentication, a user must enrollÂ his or her account with any one
  authentication type.
- For multifactor authentication, a user may have to enroll with more than one authentication type,
  depending on what the administrator has configured for a security role. See
  the[Enforce Authentication Types for Multifactor Authentication](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/policies.md#enforce-authentication-types-for-multifactor-authentication)
  topic.

## Group Management Concepts

To make the best of GroupID, you must be familiar with the following group management concepts:

- [Group Classification](#group-classification)
- [Group Types](#group-types)
- [Group Scope](#group-scope)
- [Group Security Types](#group-security-types)

## Group Classification

Using GroupID, you can manage the following three kinds of groups:

- [Unmanaged Groups](#unmanaged-groups)
- [Smart Groups](#smart-groups)
- [Dynasties](#dynasties)

### Unmanaged Groups

An unmanaged group, also called a static group, is a group you normally create in a directory, for
example, by using the Active Directory Users and Computers console. Though such groups can be
created using the GroupID portal and Management Shell, GroupID does not support dynamic updates to
them. Any changes to the membership have to be updated manually.

### Smart Groups

A Smart Group is one that dynamically maintains its membership based on rules. These rules are
applied in the form of a user-defined query, such as an LDAP query. This query is defined once and
scheduled for membership update using a Smart Group Update schedule. When the schedule runs, it
applies the defined rules to the directory and fetches matching records to update the group's
memberships.

In this way, Smart Groups are automatically updated whenever the user information changes in the
directory. This automated group management allows administrators to easily maintain large
distribution lists and security groups without having to manually add or remove members.

### Dynasties

A Dynasty is a Smart Group that creates and manages other Smart Groups using information in the
directory. Dynasties help you manage large distribution lists by creating hierarchical group
structures that represent your organization. The Smart Groups that the Dynasty creates are called
child groups and become members of their respective parent Dynasty.

A Dynasty retrieves data from the directory on the same pattern as a Smart Group does, but it has
its own mechanism of dividing the query results into child groups.

#### The Group-by Field Determines Child Groups

When you create a Dynasty, you specify a query and a field, referred to as the group-by field. The
group-by field is used to divide the query results into groups.

For example, if you set âdepartmentâ as the group-by field, then each distinct value for the
âdepartmentâ field is returned, for instance, Sales, Marketing, and Human Resources. Thus, a Dynasty
with the group-by field set to âdepartmentâ creates child groups for each distinct value: Sales,
Marketing, and Human Resources.

#### Built-in Updates

GroupID keeps the Dynasty active in two ways:

- By adding new child groups as new values are returned for the group-by field.
- By removing existing child groups as previous values of the group-by field no longer exist in the
  directory.

Thus, as new values of the âdepartmentâ field appear, new groups are created, and as old values
disappear, the corresponding child groups are deleted.

The same process occurs with the membership of each child group. When a userâs department changes
from Sales to Marketing, for example, the user is removed from the Sales child group and added to
the Marketing child group.

#### The Parent-child Relationship

Dynasty children inherit their parent's characteristics and properties, such as group type, group
security, expiry policy, owner, delivery restrictions, message size restrictions and more.
Inheritance saves administrators incalculable time through the systematic application of predefined
properties to new groups.

You can modify the values of all inherited attributes for a child, except the expiry policy. Child
Dynasties always inherit the expiry policy from the parent Dynasty and it can only be modified at
the parent level.

#### Dynasty Types

GroupID provides the following templates for creating Dynasties:

- **Organizational** - to create a Smart Group for every distinct company, then for each department
  within a company, and finally for each title in a department.
- **Geographical** - to create a Smart Group for every distinct country, then for each state within
  a country, and finally for each city within a state.
- **Managerial** - to either create separate Smart Groups for the direct reports of each manager or
  add all direct reports of the top manager and sub-level managers to a single group.
- **Custom** - to begin with a blank Dynasty and select your own group-by attributes.

These templates provide predefined group-by attributes for creating Dynasty levels. You can also
define custom group-by attributes to expand the Dynasty levels to suit your organizational model.
You can also combine an external data source with the templates to provide extended criteria for
determining group membership.

## Group Types

Groups fall into two functional categories: distribution groups and security groups.

### Distribution Groups

Distribution groups, also called distribution lists, are designed to combine users together so that
you can send emails (via a mail server) to a group rather than individually to each user in the
group.

Distribution groups can be used only with email applications, such as Microsoft Exchange. These
groups are not security-enabled, which means that they cannot be listed in discretionary access
control lists (DACLs). If you need a group for controlling access to shared resources, create a
security group.

### Security Groups

Security groups provide an efficient way to assign access to resources on your network. Using
security groups, you can:

- **Assign user rights** - User rights are assigned to security groups to determine what members of
  that group can do within the scope of a domain (or forest). For example, a user who is added to
  the Backup Operators group can back-up and restore files and directories located on each domain
  controller in the domain. By being a member of this group, you inherit the user rights assigned to
  the group.
- **Assign permissions to resources**- This is different from user rights because user rights apply
  across an entire domain versus permissions that are directed to a specific entity. Permissions
  determine who can access the resource and the level of access, such as Full Control or Read-only.

Security groups can also be used as a distribution group in Exchange. These are known as
security-enabled distribution groups.

## Group Scope

Groups are characterized by a scope that identifies the extent to which the group is applied in a
domain or forest. The boundary, or reach, of a group scope is also determined by the domain
functional level of the domain in which it resides.

A groupâs scope determines:

- the domains from where members can be added to the group
- the domains where the group can be used to grant permissions
- the domains where the group can be nested in other groups

A group can be of universal, global, or domain local scope.

### Universal

Use groups with universal scope to consolidate groups that span domains. To do this, add the
accounts to groups with global scope, and then nest these groups within groups that have universal
scope. When you use this strategy, any membership changes in the groups that have global scope do
not affect the groups with universal scope.

Do not change the membership of a group with universal scope frequently, because membership changes
cause the entire membership of the group to be replicated to every global catalog in the forest.

### Global

Use groups with global scope to manage directory objects that require daily maintenance, such as
user and computer accounts. Because groups with global scope are not replicated outside their own
domain, you can change accounts in a group having global scope frequently without generating
replication traffic to the global catalog.

As a best practice, you should use global groups or universal groups rather than domain local groups
when you specify permissions on domain directory objects that are replicated to the global catalog.

A global group can contain users, computers, and groups from the same domain but not universal
groups.

### Domain Local

Groups with domain local scope help you define and manage access to resources within a single
domain. For example, to give five users access to a printer, you can add all five user accounts in
the printer permissions list.

A domain local group can contain users, computers, global groups, and universal groups from any
domain in the forest and any trusted domain, as well as domain local groups from the same domain.
Such a group can be a member of any domain local group in the same domain.

## Group Security Types

A groupâs security type determines how non-members can access the group and become its members.
GroupID provides three security types:

- **Private** - to restrict access to the group to members selected by the group owner. Only the
  owner can add or remove members from the group. Requests to join or leave the group cannot be
  submitted.
- **Semi-Private** - to restrict access to the group to members selected by the group owner.
  However, requests to join or leave the group can be sent to the owner.
- **Public** - to allow all users to access the group. Users can join or leave the group at will and
  do not require any permissions to do so. The administrator can configure email notifications to be
  sent to the group owner when a user joins or leaves the group.

## Auth Summary

This card employs a pie chart to display the authentication stats and trends for an identity store,
i.e., the number of successful and failed authentication attempts made by identity store users in
GroupID. Information is based on:

- Authentication attempts made using authentication types for second factor authentication.
- Authentication attempts made using authentication types for multifactor authentication.
- Sign in attempts made using username and password.

The pie chart is highly interactive. You can:

- Hover the mouse over an arc to view the successful or failed authentication attempt count.
- Click the arc for successful or failed attempts to view successful/failed authentication attempts
  for each authentication type. Another pie chart appears to display the authentication types used
  in the authentication attempt. Click this chart to navigate to the **History** tab of the
  **Helpdesk** page to view the logged history for the authentication attempts with the respective
  authentication type. See the
  [History in Helpdesk](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/help-desk/index.md) topic.

Consider the following:

- You can view authentication data for an identity store individuallyÂ or view aggregated data for
  all identity stores in GroupID. Select an identity store from the list next to the card name to
  view the auth data for it or select _All Identity Stores_ to view the data for all identity
  stores.
- By default, data is displayed for the last one week. You can view authentication data for any
  specific period. Click the tile showing the time period to launch the calendar. Use it to specify
  a date range to view the data.

See the
[Authentication Policy](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/configuration/identity-stores/active-directory.md)
topic for a list of supported authentication types.

## Customize the Create Object Wizards

Using a portal, users can create different directory objects, namely:

- User
- Mailbox
- Contact
- Static Group
- Smart Group
- Organizational Dynasty
- Geographical Dynasty
- Managerial Dynasty
- Custom Dynasty

The portal provides a separate wizard for creating each of these objects. You can customize a wizard
as needed.

NOTE: In the portal, the _Create Group_ wizard starts with the _Group Type_ page, where users can
select the type of group they want to create. Options on this page vary, depending on the
permissions assigned to the user in the identity store. (See the
[Security Role â Permissions](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/security-roles.md)
topic.)

- If a user has the _Create Static Group_ permission and is denied the _Create Smart Group_
  permission, only the _Static Group_ option is displayed on the _Group Type_ page.
- If a user has the _Create Smart Group_ permission and is denied the _Create Static Group_
  permission, all options except _Static Group_ are displayed on the _Group Type_ page.
  ![group_type](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/group_type.webp)

NOTE: You can customize the _Group Type_ page individually for static group, Smart Group, and each
of the Dynasty types. However:

- If a user has permissions to create both static groups and Smart Groups, the _Group Type_ page
  created for _Static Group_ would be displayed to the user in the portal.
- If a user does not have permission to create static groups, but has permission to create Smart
  Groups, the _Group Type_ page created for _Smart Group_ would be displayed to the user in the
  portal for Smart Groups and Dynasties.

## Specify Attributes for Import/Export of Group Owners and Members

In the GroupID portal, users can:

- Export members and additional owners of a group to a file, such as a csv or an xls file
- Import members and additional owners for a group from a file. Members can also be imported from an
  external data source.

You can specify schema attributes to be used for export/import, along with a user-friendly name for
each attribute.

- The import function reads the objectsâ information from an external file or data source and
  searches for matching objects in the directory based on field mapping (where a column name in the
  file or data source is mapped to any of the attributes specified here).  
  Objects having the same values for the mapped fields are added to the membership or additional
  ownership of the target group.
- The export function reads the membership/additional ownership of the group and exports the values
  of the specified attributes for members/additional owners to an external file.

The schema attributes you specify are displayed with their user-friendly names on the following
wizards in the portal:

| Wizard Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Import Members           | This wizard is used to import members to a group using a file or an external data source. Users can launch it from the Members page on the Create Group wizard and from the Members tab in group properties. |
| Export Members           | This wizard is used to export the members of a group to an external file. Users can launch it from the Members tab in group properties.                                                                      |
| Import Additional Owners | This wizard is used to import additional owners to a group using an external file. Users can launch it from the Owners page on the Create Group wizard and from the Owner tab in group properties.           |
| Export Additional Owners | This wizard is used to export the additional owners of a group to an external file. Users can launch it from the Owner tab in group properties.                                                              |

NOTE: The attributes you specify apply to all four wizards. You cannot specify a different set of
attributes for a wizard.

## Specify Attributes for the Object Card

In the portal, the names of directory objects are displayed as links. When a user hovers the mouse
over this link, a card is displayed, showcasing information about the object. For a user object, for
example, the card displays the name, email address and phone number. It is as:

![usercard](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/usercard.webp)

For each object type, you can specify a different set of attributes to display on this card. For a
group, the card is as:

![groupcard](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/groupcard.webp)

Notice that the card has three sections, namely:

- Header - The card template allows for four attributes to be specified for display in the header.
  When a specified attribute does not contain a value, NA is displayed on the card.
- Body - You can specify any number of attributes for this section. When you do not specify any
  attribute, this section is not displayed.
- Footer - This section has the _Add To Contact_ and _Send An Email_ buttons. You can choose whether
  you want to display these buttons on the card or not.

In the portal, the object list refers to a listing of groups that are similar to another group,
Group similarity is measured on the basis of group type and membership.

Letâs assume you want to view the groups that are similar to Group A. On the **Similar Groups** tab
in Group Aâs properties, six groups that bear the most similarity to Group A will be displayed, with
the strongest match at the top. It is as:

![similar_groups](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/similar_groups.webp)

For a similar group, three attributes are displayed:

- Attribute 1 - The groupâs display name. This attribute cannot be changed.
- Attribute 2 - You can specify any attribute. The default attribute is _mail_.
- Attribute 3 - You can specify any attribute. The default attribute is _expiration policy_.

   page.
6. Click **Add**. The **Add Design Category** pane is displayed.
7. Enter a name for the tab in the **Name** box. The tab will be displayed on the objectâs
   properties page with this name.
8. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The tab would be visible to
   users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. The tab would not be
   visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their direct
   reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See
   [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/security-roles.md).

   - Select _Never_ to hide the tab from all users.
   - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the tab visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
     manager (in case of a user or contact). It would be hidden from other users, such as group
     members or a user. For example:

     - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Email_ tab in group properties, the tab would
       be visible to group owners for their respective groups in the portal.
     - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Account_ tab in user properties, the tab would
       be visible to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.

   - If you have selected âUserâ or âMailboxâ in the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list,
     the _Self_ option is also available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_
     to make the tab visible to the respective user or mailbox. It would be hidden from other
     users, such as the userâs manager. For example, if the _Self_ role is selected for the
     _General_ tab in user properties, it means that:

     - A user can view the General tab on his or her properties page. He or she cannot view this
       tab on the properties page of another user.
     - A role with a higher priority value cannot see it for another user.
     - User managers cannot view it for their direct reports.
     - A role with the âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store cannot view it for
       other users.

9. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles with
   a priority value higher than it can add and update the values of fields on this tab. If group
   owners/user managers fall in a lower priority role, they cannot update the fields on the tab for
   their respective groups/direct reports. See
   [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/security-roles.md).

   - Select _Never_ to make the tab and its fields read-only for all users.
   - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case of a
     user or contact) to specify or modify the value of the fields on the tab. It would be
     read-only for other users, such as group members or the respective user. For example, if
     _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Email_ tab in group properties, it means that:

     - Only group owners can specify or modify the values of fields on this tab for their
       respective groups in the portal.
     - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update field values.
     - Group members cannot specify or update field values.
     - A role with the âManage any Groupâ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
       update field values.

   - If you have selected âUserâ or âMailboxâ in the **Select Directory Object** list, the _Self_
     option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list.  
     Select _Self_ to enable the respective user or mailbox to specify or modify the value of the
     fields on the tab. The tab would be read-only for the userâs manager and other users. For
     example, if _Self_ is selected for the _General_ tab in user properties, it means that:

     - Only the user can add and update the values of fields on the General tab of his or her
       properties page.
     - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update field values.
     - The userâs manager cannot specify or update field values.
     - A role with the âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store cannot specify or

      manager (in case of a user or contact). It would be hidden from other users, such as group
      members or a user. For example:

      - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Expiration Date_ field on the _General_ tab in
        group properties, the field would be visible to group owners for their respective groups
        in the portal.
      - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Manager_ field on the _Organization_ tab in
        user properties, the field would be visible to managers for their direct reports in the

      the _Self_ option is also available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_
      to make the field visible to the respective user or mailbox. It would be hidden from other
      users, such as the userâs manager. For example, if _Self_ is selected for the _Notes_ field on
      the _Phone/Notes_ tab in user properties, it means that:

      - A user can view the field on his or her properties page only. He or she cannot see this
        field on the properties page of another user.
      - A role with a higher priority value cannot view it for another user.
      - User managers cannot view it for their direct reports.
      - A role with the âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store cannot view it for

    owners/user managers fall in a lower priority role, they cannot able to update the value of the
    field for their respective groups/direct reports. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/security-roles.md).

    - Select _Never_ to make this field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a user or contact) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for
      other users, such as group members or the respective user. For example, if _Manager and Owner_
      is selected for the _Expiration Date_ field on the _General_ tab in group properties, it means
      that:

      - Only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their groups in the
        portal.
      - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update the field value.
      - Group members cannot specify or update the field value.
      - A role with the âManage any Groupâ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
        update the field value.

    - If you have selected âUserâ or âMailboxâ in the **Select Directory Object** list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to enable the
      respective user or mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. The field would be
      read-only for other users, such as the userâs manager or a role with a higher priority value.
      For example, if _Self_ is selected for the _Notes_ field on the _Phone / Notes_ tab in user
      properties, it means that:

      - Only the respective user can add and update the value of this field on the _Phone / Notes_
        tab in his or her properties page.
      - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update the field value.
      - The userâs manager cannot specify or update the field value.
      - A role with the âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
        update the field values.

13. Click **Advanced Options** to display additional fields.
14. As mentioned for visibility level and access level, the field is visible and editable for
    members of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than it.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
15. In the **Tooltip Text** box, enter the text to display when a user hovers the mouse over the
    field.
16. In the **Max Length** box, enter a number that represents the maximum number of characters that
    users can enter as value for this field.  
    Entering _0_ indicates that users can enter an unlimited number of characters as value.
17. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types (User, Contact, and/or Group)
    that can be searched on the portalâs _Find_ dialog box, to set as value for the field.  
    The following display types support the **Find** dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
    - Custom display types created with the Grid type

    When you select any of these display types, GroupID identifies that the value for the field has
    to be searched and selected using the _Find_ dialog box. The **Search Object Types** area is
    displayed, where you can select the required object type(s). For example, if you select _Group_,
    only groups can be searched and selected as value for the field.  
    You can launch the _Find_ dialog box from multiple portal pages to search for objects to
    designate as owners, managers, additional owners, members, and more. While specifying the
    searchable object type(s), you must be aware of the kind of value the field requires.

    supports âthumbnailPhotoâ as its value.

    - Select the âthumbnailPhotoâ attribute in the **Image Attribute** drop-down list when you want
      to auto upload an image for the field. Letâs assume you apply this setting for the Primary
      Manager field in group properties. In the portal, the primary manager's image will be
      displayed alongside his or her name on the group properties page.  
      Note that for the image to display, the âthumbnailPhotoâ attribute must have a value stored;
      in case of no value, an image placeholder is displayed.
    - If you do not want to auto upload an image for the field, clear the value in the **Image
      Attribute** box.

22. Click **OK**.  
    The field is displayed in the **Fields** area on the **Edit Design Category** pane. You can
    rearrange the fields, update field details, and even remove a field from the tab.
23. Click **OK**.

## Specify Attributes for Organizational Hierarchy

Using the portal, you can view the organizational hierarchy for a user in the organization. This
hierarchy is displayed in graphical form, creating a kind of an organogram. It presents a 360Â° view
of the organization with the specified user as the focal point.

By default, the organizational hierarchy chart displays four attributes of a user: _title_, _display
name_, _email_, and _picture_. You can replace an attribute with another one but you cannot add or
remove attributes. Hence the attribute count remains âfourâ.

What do you want to do?

## Manage Property Validation Attributes

In GroupID, property validation applies to:

- Users
- Groups

### Profile Validation for Users

Profile validation is designed to ensure the accuracy of usersâ information in the directory. It
applies to users who are members of the group specified for profile validation in an identity store.
These users must verify and update their directory profile information at a set frequency using the
portal.

While validating his or her profile, a user can:

- Update his or her directory profile information
- Change his or her primary manager
- Transfer his or her direct reports to another manager
- Terminate his or her direct reports

You can specify the schema attributes (fields) for user profile validation. These attributes
(fields) are displayed on the **Validate Profile Properties** window of the portal, where users can
validate and update the values for these attributes.

NOTE: A few fields for profile validation are specified in the default portal template. You can add
more fields, edit the existing fields, or remove them. However, the **My Direct Reports** field can
neither be edited nor removed.

### Property Validation for Groups

The GroupID administrator can enforce group owners to review and validate the attributes and
membership of an expiring group before renewing it. See the
[Enable Group Attestation](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/configuration/identity-stores/active-directory.md#enable-group-attestation)
topic.

While attesting a group in the portal, the owner can:

- Update a few attributes, such as the groupâs display name, expiration policy, security type, etc.
- Verify the groupâs membership and inactivate undesired members. Inactive members are removed from
  group membership instantly or after x number of days, depending on the configurations made by the
  administrator.

Group attestation applies to expiring groups with an expiry policy other than ânever expireâ.

You can specify the schema attributes (fields) for group attestation. These attributes (fields) are
displayed on the **Attest & Renew Group** wizard in the portal, where group owners can validate and
update the values for these attributes.

NOTE: A few fields for group attestation are specified in the default portal template. You can add
more fields, edit the existing fields, or remove them. However, the _Members_ grid can neither be
edited nor removed.

## Specify Smart Group Query Attributes

For an identity store, you can choose whether all or specific schema attributes should be available
on the following pages in the portal:

- The Query Designer, where you can specify queries for Smart Groups and Dynasties for membership
  update. The Query Designer can be launched from:

  - The Create Object wizard for Smart Groups and Dynasties
  - The properties page for Smart Groups and Dynasties
  - When you upgrade a static group to a Smart Group or Dynasty

  The schema attributes you specify would be available to portal users on the Filter Criteria tab
  of the Query Designer for building Smart Group/Dynasty queries.

  ![filter_criteria_tab](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/filter_criteria_tab.webp)

- The Sub-Manager Query Designer for a Recursive Managerial Dynasty, where you can specify a query
  for sub-manager selection.

  ![sub-manager_query](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/sub-manager_query.webp)

- The **Add Attributes** dialog box for Dynasties. The schema attributes you specify would be
  available in the _Group Items By_ field, which is used to divide the query results into groups.
  GroupID creates a new child group for each unique value of the attribute that users select in the
  _Group Items By_ field.

  ![add_attributes](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/add_attributes.webp)

- The Query Designer for importing members to a group using an external data source. The specified
  schema attributes would be available on the Filter Criteria tab of the Query Designer for building
  membership import queries.  
  You can launch this Query Designer using the **Import** button on the **Members** tab in group
  properties (for static groups, Smart Groups and Dynasties).  
  ![importmembers](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/importmembers.webp)
- The Query Designer for query-based search, where users can define a query to search the
  directory.  
  The schema attributes you specify would be available to portal users on the Filter Criteria tab of
  the Query Designer for building search queries.  
  Users can launch the Query Designer for searches from the portalâs Advanced Search page.

You can also specify the following for an attribute:

- The operator(s) that can be applied to the attribute on the Query Designer dialog boxes. For
  example, if you allow the âContainsâ and âEqualsâ operators for the âcnâ attribute, then only
  these operators will be displayed when users select the âcnâ attribute on any of the Query
  Designers.
- The display type to use for specifying the value of the attribute. For example, it can be a simple
  text box, a drop-down list, or a button that launches the Find dialog box for searching and
  selecting an object.
- The maximum number of characters that users can enter as value for an attribute.

## The âSend on Behalfâ and âSend Asâ Permissions

Using the portal, a user can delegate the _Send on Behalf_ and _Send As_ permissions to other
objects.

### The Send on Behalf Permission

The _Send on Behalf_ permission in Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 allows a user to send an email
as another user, while showing the recipient that it was sent from a user on behalf of another user.

For example, when User A grants Send on Behalf permissions to User B, then User B can send email on
behalf of User A. User B will be able to choose User Aâs email address in the âFromâ field when
composing a message in Outlook. Message recipients will see both User Aâs address and User Bâs
address, as the âFromâ address will read as:

_From: Mailbox `<User B's address>` on behalf of Mailbox `<User Aâs address>`._

### The Send As Permission

The _Send As_ permission in Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 enables a user to send a message as
another user. For example, when User A grants _Send As_ permissions to User B, User B will be able
to choose User Aâs email address in the âFromâ field when composing a message in Outlook. This
message, while sent by User B, will appear as sent by User A.

### Prerequisites for the Send As and Send on Behalf Permissions

In the following content, a âtarget objectâ refers to the object that can add other objects to its
Send As and Send on Behalf lists using the portal.

- The target object can be a mailbox or a mail-enabled group.
- Microsoft Exchange or Office 365 must be configured as the messaging provider for the identity
  store.
- An SMTP server must be configured for the identity store.
- The user logged in the portal must have the âManage any Profileâ permission for its respective
  role in the identity store.
- The XAdPermissionExtendedRights attribute should be available for Send As and the publicDelegates
  attribute should be available for Send on Behalf.
- The ExchangeTrustedsubsystem object should have modify permissions on the target objects in Active
  Directory for the Send As permission to be set using the portal. For more information, see
  [Access denied when you try to give user "send-as" or "receive as" permission for a Distribution Group in Exchange Server](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/access-denied-when-you-try-to-give-user-send-as-or-receive-as-permission-for-a-distribution-group-in-exchange-server-505822f4-8dca-7b97-d378-c8416553f6d2).

## Set up the Send As Feature

You can provide the Send As setting on any tab of an objectâs properties page in the portal. This
would enable the object to delegate the Send As permission to users.

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane. The **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list, select a Mailbox or Group object to add the
   Send As setting to its properties page. The **Name** list displays the tabs on the objectâs
   properties page.
6. Click **Edit** for a tab (for example, the **Email** tab).  
   The **Edit Design Category** pane is displayed, with the **Fields** area displaying the fields on
   the tab.
7. Click **Add Field** to add the **Send As** field. The **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select the _XAdPermissionExtendedRights_ attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** box, provide a label for the field, such as âSend As Permissionsâ. The
   Send As field will be displayed with this name in the portal.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select âDNsâ.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The Send As field would be
    visible to users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It would
    not even be visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their
    direct reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/security-roles.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a mailbox). It would be hidden from other users, such as group members or
      the mailbox itself. In other words, the field would be visible to group owners for their
      respective groups and to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.
    - If you have selected âMailboxâ in the Select Directory Object list, the _Self_ option is also
      available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to make the field visible
      only to the mailbox on his or her properties page. It would not be visible to any other user,
      such as a role with a higher priority value or a role with the âManage any profileâ permission
      in the identity store.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of the Send As field,
    i.e., add and remove objects in the Send As list. If group owners/user managers fall in a lower
    priority role, they would not be able to update the value of the field for their respective
    groups/direct reports.

    - Select _Never_ to make the field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a mailbox) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for other
      users, such as group members or the mailbox itself.  
      In other words, only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective groups in the portal. A role with a higher priority value cannot change the value;
      group members cannot change the value; and even a role with the âManage any Groupâ permission
      in the identity store cannot change the value.  
      Similarly, only mailbox managers can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective direct reports in the portal. A role with a higher priority value cannot change the
      value; and even a role with the âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store cannot
      change the value.
    - If you have selected âMailboxâ in the Select Directory Object drop-down list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select **Self** to enable the
      mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. It would be read-only for other users,
      such as the mailboxâs manager or a role with a higher priority value or even a role with the
      âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store.

13. As mentioned for access level and visibility level, the field is editable and visible to members
    of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than the selected role.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
14. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types that can be searched on the
    portalâs Find dialog box, to set as value for the _Send As_ field.  
    The following display types support the Find dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
    - Custom display types created with the Grid type

    When you select any of these display types, GroupID identifies that the value for the _Send As_
    field has to be searched using the Find dialog box. The **Search Object Types** area is
    displayed, where you can select the required object type(s). For example, if you select User,
    only user objects can be searched and selected as value for the field.

15. Select the **Is Required** check box to make it mandatory for users to add at least one object
    to the _Send As_ list.
16. Select the **Is Read Only** check box to make the _Send As_ field read-only.
17. Click **OK** on the **Add Field** pane and the **Edit Design Category** pane.
18. Click **Save** on the **Properties** page.

#### The Send As Field in the Portal

Launch the portal and go to the properties of the target object (group or mailbox) you defined the
Send As field for, then click the respective tab. The Send As field is displayed as follows:

![sendas](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/sendas.webp)

Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to add and remove objects in the Send As list. The added
objects can send email for the target object in accordance with the Send As functionality.

## Set up the Send on Behalf Feature

You can provide the Send on Behalf setting on any tab of an objectâs properties page in the portal.
This would enable the object to delegate the Send on Behalf permission to users.

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane. The **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** list, select a Mailbox or Group object to add the Send on
   Behalf setting to its properties page. The **Name** list displays the tabs on the objectâs
   properties page.
6. Click **Edit** for a tab (for example, the **Email** tab).  
   The **Edit Design Category** pane is displayed, with the **Fields** area displaying the fields on
   the tab.
7. Click **Add Field** to add the **Send on Behalf** field. The **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select the _publicDelegates_ attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** provide a label for the field, such as âSend on Behalf Permissionsâ. The
   Send on Behalf field will be displayed with this name on the portal.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select âDNsâ.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The Send on Behalf field
    would be visible to users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It
    would not be visible to group owners (for their groups) and user managers (for their direct
    reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/security-roles.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a mailbox). It would be hidden from other users, such as group members or
      the mailbox itself. In other words, the field would be visible to group owners for their
      respective groups and to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.
    - If you have selected âMailboxâ in the Select Directory Object list, the _Self_ option is also
      available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to make the field visible
      only to the mailbox on his or her properties page. It would not be visible to any other user,
      such as a role with a higher priority value or a role with the âManage any profileâ permission
      in the identity store.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of the Send on Behalf
    field, i.e., add and remove objects in the Send on Behalf list. If group owners/user managers
    fall in a lower priority role, they would not be able to update the value of the field for their
    respective groups/direct reports.

    - Select _Never_ to make the field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a mailbox) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for other
      users, such as group members or the mailbox itself.  
      In other words, only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective groups in the portal. A role with a higher priority value, group members, or a role
      with the âManage any Groupâ permission in the identity store cannot change the value.  
      Similarly, only mailbox managers can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective direct reports in the portal. A role with a higher priority value or a role with
      the âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store cannot change the value.
    - If you have selected âMailboxâ in the _Select Directory Object_ drop-down list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select **Self** to enable the
      mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. It would be read-only for other users,
      such as the mailboxâs manager or a role with a higher priority value or even a role with the
      âManage any profileâ permission in the identity store.

13. As mentioned for access level and visibility level, the field is editable and visible to members
    of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than the selected role.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
14. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types that can be searched on the
    portalâs Find dialog box, to set as value for the _Send on Behalf_ field.  
    The following display types support the Find dialog box:

## Display Type Categories

Using display types, you can publish fields in a GroupID portal to capture and view data.

A field can be anything from a text box to a drop-down list to a check box, depending on the display
type linked to it. You must also link each field to a schema attribute in the directory. Users can
use the fields in a portal to add and update values for the respective attributes.

## Schema Attributes and Display Types

Each schema attribute requires a value of a certain type.

- Some attributes require a single string value.  
  Example: Active Directory attributes _name_ and _sAMAccountName_
- Other attributes can accept multiple values.  
  Example: Active Directory attribute _proxyAddress_
- Some attributes accept only one or more distinguished names (DN).  
  Example: Active Directory attributes _members_ and _memberOf_
- Some attributes allow only Boolean values (true or false).  
  Example: Active Directory attributes _hideDLMembership_ and _isDeleted_

To ensure that portal users update these attributes as supported by the directory, display types
play an important role. A display type enables you to define the user interface element to use for
an attribute in the portal (for example, text box, drop-down list, check box, etc.). This user
interface element must support the type of data that can be entered as the attribute value, so that
users enter valid data through the portal.

## Display Type Categories

Display types support almost all types of schema attributes, such as single-valued, multi-valued,
Boolean, and distinguished name. Based on their characteristics and customization options, display
types are divided into two categories:

- Basic display types
- Custom display types

### Basic Display Types

You can link a basic display type to a schema attribute straight away. Basic display types are:

- **Text box**

  Use it to collect and display a single value for an attribute. You can link it directly to a
  schema attribute. However, to apply additional rules to it, such as assigning a default value or
  implementing a regular expression to validate the data entered, you must create a custom display
  type from this basic type. See the
  [Text Box Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.

- **Password**

  Use this display type with schema attributes that store confidential information. The user
  interface element is displayed as a text box in the portal with bullets or asterisks in place of
  text.

- **Multi-value**

  Use it for schema attributes that can accept multiple string values.  
   A multi-value display type is displayed in the portal as:

  ![multi-value_display_type](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/displaytype/multi-value_display_type.webp)

  Clicking **Add** launches a dialog box where users can add new values.

- **Check box**

  Use it for schema attributes that accept true or false values, such as the Active Directory
  attributes _reportToOwner_, _reportToOriginator_, and _oOFReplyToOriginator_.

- **DN**

  Use it for schema attributes that accept a single distinguished name for their value, such as
  the Active Directory attributes _Assistant_ and _altRecipient_. The user interface element for
  this display type appears as a button that launches the **Find** dialog box, where users can
  search and select objects. It is as:

  ![dn](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/displaytype/dn.webp)

- **DNs**

  Use it for schema attributes that accept multiple distinguished names, for example, the Active
  Directory attributes _member_ and _memberOf_. The user interface element for this display type
  is as follows:

  ![multi-value_display_type](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/displaytype/multi-value_display_type.webp)

  Clicking **Add** displays a quick search field along with an option to launch the **Find**
  dialog box where users can search and select the desired objects.

### Custom Display Types

Some display types cannot be linked to schema attributes straight away; they must be customized
first.

Display types that require customization are:

- Text box - you can use it directly with an attribute, but if you want to apply data validation
  checks to it, you must convert it to a custom display type.
- Drop-down list
- Linked-field drop-down list
- Image
- Grid
- Radio
- Multiline text box
- Linked combo

Some applications of display type are:

- Define a simple text box type for a telephone number field and apply a validation rule so that it
  accepts phone numbers in US format only.
- Define a drop-down list display type containing a list of the departments in your organization.
- Create a linked field drop-down list type where selecting the office address auto populates the
  phone number and fax number.

The default portal template uses several predefined custom display types. See the
[Define Custom Display Types](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
topic to add more display types as needed.

The **Custom Display Types** page in a portalâs design settings lists all the predefined custom
display types and any custom display types you may have added.

- [Design a Portal with Display Types](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Define Custom Display Types](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)

## Define Custom Display Types

In GroupID, several predefined custom display types are used in the default portal template. To
customize the portal, you can use the predefined custom display types as well as define new ones.

- [Text Box Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Drop-down List Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Linked Field Drop-down List Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Image Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Grid Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Radio Button Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Multiline Textbox Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
- [Linked Combo Display Type](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)

## How to Implement Display Types

On the Search Forms, Properties, Create Object, and Property Validation pages in a portalâs design
settings, select a schema attribute and a display type to link them.

On linking, the display type is rendered on the portalâs page; enabling users to view or specify a
value for the linked attribute.

## Delete a Custom Display Type

You can delete custom display types, including linked combos.

NOTE: You cannot delete a custom display type that has been linked to a field in the portal.

To delete a custom display type:

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to delete a custom display type for it.  
   All identity stores associated with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can
   design a different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Custom Display Types** in the left pane.

   - On the **Simple Types** tab, click **Delete** for a custom display type to delete it.
   - On the **Linked Combo Types** tab, click **Delete** for a linked combo to delete it.

5. Click **Save**.

## Drop-down List Display Type

Use the drop-down list display type to give portal users a list of options to select from.

To create a custom drop-down list display type, you have to specify the values (options) to display
in the list. This custom display type can then be linked to a schema attribute. Options in the
drop-down list are the different values that users can select for the schema attribute you link this
display type with.

### Predefined Drop-down List Display Types

A few drop-down list display types used in the default portal template are:

|     | Display Type Name  | Default Value              | Values                                                                        |
| --- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.  | lstSecurity        | Private: Closed Membership | Public Semi-Private: Owner Must Approve Private: Closed Membership            |
| 2.  | lstGroupScope      | Universal Group            | Domain Local Global Group Universal Group                                     |

## Grid Display Type

Use a grid display type to display data in tabular form in the portal. This is especially helpful
when you want to group together multiple attributes of an object.

For example, use a grid display type to capture information about a groupâs additional owners and
members, such as a memberâs display name, department, and email. Add a column to the grid for each
attribute required, so that portal users can view or enter values in each column (attribute) for an
object.

To create a grid, simply define its columns. Each column is mapped to a schema attribute, so each
column represents the value of the attribute it is mapped to.

After creating the custom grid display type, link it to an appropriate schema attribute to render it
on a portal page. This attribute must support multi-valued distinguished names. Examples of such
Active Directory attributes include _member_ and _memberof_.

### Predefined Grid Display Types

A few grid display types used in the default portal template are:

| Display Type Name | Column Names                             | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| membersgrid       | Display Name Membership Beginning Ending | Used to display the members in a group, with the display name, membership type, and membership start and end dates for each member. |
| groupMemberOfGrid | Display Name Email Description           | Used to display the groups an object is a member of, with the display name, email address, and description shown for each group.    |
| directReportsGrid | Display Name Status                      | Used to display the direct reports of a user, with the display name and status shown for each direct report.                        |

## Image Display Type

Use the image display type for schema attributes of the user object type that can store image data.
The following table lists the supported attributes for Active Directory:

| AD Attribute   | CN        | Description                                                                                                                                             | Max. Image Size (KB) |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| jpegPhoto      | JpegPhoto | Stores one or more images of a user in JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF). The image stored in this attribute is mainly used by SharePoint.            | 10240                |
| Photo          | Photo     | An object encoded in G3 fax as explained in recommendation T.4, with an ASN.1 wrapper to make it compatible with an X.400 BodyPart as defined in X.420. | NA                   |
| thumbnailPhoto | Picture   | An image of a user for display in Outlook. A space-efficient format like JPEG or GIF is recommended.                                                    | 100                  |
| thumbnailLogo  | Logo      | A small-sized image; a userâs logo.                                                                                                                     | 32                   |

To define an image display type, specify the imageâs display dimensions (height and width), that
would be used to display the image in the portal. You must also specify the maximum image size that
can be uploaded for this display type.

A custom image display type is rendered on a portal page as:

![photo_placeholder](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/displaytype/photo_placeholder.webp)

Click **Edit** to launch the **Manage Photo** dialog box for uploading a photo. The dialog box also
provides many image editing options, including rotate, crop, flip, and re-size.

## Linked Field Drop-down List Display Type

A linked field drop-down list is displayed in the portal as a drop-down list with multiple values.
When a user selects a value, all fields linked to that value are auto populated. Since these fields
remain isolated, they are not displayed to the user.

Use a linked field drop-down list, for example, when you want the _Office Address, Business Phone
Number, Fax Number_ and _Email_ fields to be auto populated when a user selects his or her office
name from a drop-down list. Here, `<office name>` is the key value while Office Address, Business
Phone Number, Fax Number and Email are its linked (isolated) fields.

To define a linked field drop-down list:

- Specify a value, called a key value.
- Link schema attributes (fields) with this key value. For each attribute that you link, you must
  also provide a value.

## Multiline Textbox Display Type

A multiline textbox allows portal users to type information into a box that supports word wrapping
and vertical scrolling.

Like a textbox, use a multiline textbox display type to collect and display a single value for an
attribute.

The multiline textbox display type is especially useful for fields that require a lengthy value,
such as the _Description_ field. Moreover, as it can have multiple rows, users can view more
characters of the entered value on screen as compared to a textbox.

In the portalâs default template, the _Description_ field on the _Create New Group_ page uses the
multiline textbox display type. It is as:

![multiline_textbox](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/displaytype/multiline_textbox.webp)

To define a multiline textbox display type, provide a name for it and specify the on-screen width by
giving the number of rows to be displayed for it. Portal users can use the _Enter_ key to add as
many rows as required while entering data.

## Design a Portal with Display Types

Display types enable you to control the layout and appearance of a GroupID portal and its pages.
They also enable you to expose the required functionality and data fields in the portal.

You can associate multiple identity stores with a portal and design a different portal for each
identity store. Adding links to the navigation bar, adding pages to the portal, and adding fields to
pages are some customization examples. In this way, the portal offers a different design and
functionality for each associated identity store.

You can customize the following for a portal:

- **Search Forms:** control the fields to be displayed on different search forms and search result
  pages in a portal. See the
  [Customize Search Forms](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  and
  [Customize Search Results](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topics.
- **Quick Search:** control the schema attributes for quick search to run on. See the
  [Customize Quick Search](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- **Properties:** control what properties of directory objects you want to display in a portal. See
  the
  [Customize Properties Pages](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- **Toolbars:** customize the buttons on the portal toolbars. See the
  [Customize the Toolbars](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- **Navigation Bar:** customize the left navigation bar in a portal. See the
  [Customize the Navigation Bar](#customize-the-navigation-bar)
  topic.
- **Bad Words List:** restrict users from entering bad or offensive words while using a portal. See
  the
  [Manage the Bad Words List](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- **Import/Export Attributes:**Â specify schema attributes to be used for importing/exporting members
  and additional owners for groups. See the
  [Specify Attributes for Import/Export of Group Owners and Members](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md):
  topic.
- **Create Object Wizards:**Â control the schema attributes displayed in the portal for creating
  different object types. See the
  [Customize the Create Object Wizards](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)Â topic.
- **Query Attributes:**Â control which schema attributes to display in the portal for creating
  queries for Smart Groups ad Dynasties. See the
  [ Specify Smart Group Query Attributes](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)Â topic.
- **Property Validation:** manage the schema attributes for user profile validation and group
  attestation. See the
  [Manage Property Validation Attributes](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- **Organizational Hierarchy:** specify user attributes for display on the organizational hierarchy
  chart. See the
  [Specify Attributes for Organizational Hierarchy](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- **Card View:** specify the attributes to be displayed on an object card. See the
  [Specify Attributes for the Object Card](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- **Object List View:** specify the attributes to be displayed for similar groups on the **Similar
  Groups** tab in group properties. See the
  [Specify Attributes for Object List View](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.

## Radio Button Display Type

Use a radio display type to present the portal users with a predefined set of mutually exclusive
options, of which they can choose one. Usually radio buttons in a set are grouped together under a
label.

To create a radio display type, provide a label for a set of radio buttons and then add at least two
radio buttons to the set.

### Predefined Radio Display Types

A few radio display types used in the default portal template are:

| Display Type Name | Values                                                                                                                       | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| groupMainType     | Static Group Smart Group Password Expiry Group Organizational Dynasty Geographical Dynasty Managerial Dynasty Custom Dynasty | Enables users to specify the type of group or Dynasty they want to create.                               |
| groupType         | Security Group Distribution List                                                                                             | Enables users to specify whether they want to create a security group or a distribution list.            |
| reportTo          | Report To Originator Report To Owner Donât Send Delivery Reports                                                             | Enables users to set delivery report recipients when a message sent to a group or user is not delivered. |

## Text Box Display Type

A text box display type can be used without customization, but you must customize it when you want
to:

- specify a default value for it
- use regular expressions to validate the data users enter in the text box
- force users to provide a unique value for the field

## What are Regular Expressions?

A regular expression is a pattern of text that consists of ordinary characters (for example, letters
a through z) and special characters, known as metacharacters. You can use regular expressions to
ensure that users enter data in an input field according to a standard pattern. For example, the
regular expression for a US phone number of the pattern: (555) 123-4567 will be: ^\(\d\d\d\)
\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d.

To learn about regular expressions and their syntax, see

- [Introduction to Regular Expressions](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/28hw3sce(v%3dvs.100)>)
- [Regular Expression Syntax Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms840427.aspx)

## Predefined Text Box Display Types

A few text box display types used in the default portal template are:

|     | Display Type Name  | Default Value | Regular Expression                                             | Regex Example                        |

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to define a custom display type for it.  
   All identity stores associated with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can
   design a different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Custom Display Types** in the left pane. The **Custom Display Types** page is displayed.
5. Click **Add** on the **Custom Display Types** tab.
6. On the **New Display Type** pane, enter a name for the display type in the **Name** box.  
   You cannot change the name of a custom display type once you have created it.
7. Select _Textbox_ in the **Type** drop-down list.
8. Specify a value in the **Default Value** box to set it as the default value for the text box.
   Users can modify this value in the portal.
9. In the **Regular Expression** box, type a regular expression to use for validating data that
   users enter in the text box using the portal. Leave this box blank if you do not want to apply a
   validation rule to the data.

   1. Click **Test Regular Expression** to check if the regular expression is valid.
   2. On the **Test Regular Expression** dialog box, type an example that satisfies the regular
      expression and click **Test**.

10. In the **Error Message** box, enter the text to be displayed as an error message when portal
    users enter data in the text box that does not conform to the regular expression.
11. You can place a real-time validation check to ensure that users enter a unique value for the
    field. GroupID can look up the value for uniqueness in the directory or an external data source.
    The portal prevents users from proceeding unless a unique value is provided.

    - Select the **Unique** check box to force the user to enter a value that is unique for the
      field (attribute) in the directory.
    - You can also use an external data source, such as an Excel file, to validate the uniqueness of
      the value in real time. Use an API to connect to the external data source. Select the
      **External Validation URL** check box and enter the URL of your API in the box.

    **Example**: Link this text box display type to the group name field on the Create New Group
    page. When a user enters a name for the group, the portal will look up this name for uniqueness
    in the directory/external data source in real time and display an error message if it is not
    unique.

12. Click **OK**.
13. Click **Save** on the **Custom Display Types** page.

### External API Reference

The external API for real-time validation should receive the following parameters:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectType    | The type of object the user is creating or updating (for example, group, user).                |

## Linked Combo Type - Details

Enter the following details about the linked combo on the **Details** page of the **Linked Combo
Display Type** wozard:

1. Enter a name for the linked combo in the **Linked Combo Name** box.  
   You cannot change the name of a custom display type once you have created it.
2. Next, specify the data source for the linked combo. You can either use an already uploaded file
   or upload a new one.

   - Use the **Available Data Sources** drop-down list to select an already uploaded file. This may
     be required, for example, when your source file contains the data and relationships for
     several fields, and you want to manage those relationships using multiple linked combos rather
     than one combo. Hence the need to upload the same file for multiple linked combos.  
     The list displays all the data source files previously used to create linked combos for this
     portal. To export a file, select it and click **Export**. The file is saved to the download
     location set in your browser settings.
   - To upload a new file, click **Browse** next to the **File Name** box and select the XML or
     Microsoft Excel file containing the data to populate the linked combo and the display types
     linked to it.

   If the source file is a Microsoft Excel (.xls or .xlsx) file, GroupID automatically creates its
   XML version to process it. To learn about the Excel file format, see the
   [Excel Data File Format](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
   topic.

3. Click **Next**.

| --- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.  | Worksheet names    | The worksheet names should follow the format: **Number-Name** Where: - _Number_ is the serial number based on the order of the worksheet and it should start from zero. This means that the number for the first worksheet should be 0, the second should be 1, the third should be 2, and so on. - _Name_ is the name of the worksheet that identifies the data it contains. It can be anything you want. ![image](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/image.webp) |
| 2.  | Identity column    | Each worksheet should have an identity _(ID)_ column that contains a unique value for every record entered in the sheet. ![image1](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/image1.webp)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3.  | Name column        | Each worksheet should have a _Name_ column. This column contains the values to be displayed in the linked combo. For example, the _Name_ column in the 0-Company worksheet contains the company name for every record in the sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4.  | Foreign Key column | Each worksheet that contains data related to that on the previous sheet, should have a foreign key identity column (_FK_). This column contains the ID of the record (from the immediately previous sheet) that the current record relates to. ![image2](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/image2.webp)                                                                                                                                                           |

## Linked Combo Display Type

A linked combo is a custom display type that you can link to other display types on a portal page.
When a user selects a value from a linked combo, the values for the display types linked to it are
populated accordingly. A common application of the linked combo involves the _country, state_, and
_city_ fields. When a user selects a country, the _state_ field changes to display the states in
that country. On selecting a state, the city field displays the cities in that state.

In the default portal template, one linked combo display type _CountryState_ is defined, that
establishes a relationship between the country and state fields. Selecting a country populates the
_State_ list.

A linked combo display type also allows for more complex linking between fields, such as would be
needed to link the office, city, state, and country fields. Relationships can be extended to any
level. You can define one linked combo display type to manage these relationships, or simplify the
task by defining multiple combos, for example:

- The first linked combo establishes a relationship between the country and state fields.
- The second linked combo establishes a relationship between the state and city fields.
- The third establishes a relationship between the city and office fields.

Before creating a linked combo, you must create and maintain an external data file containing the
data and relationships for the required fields. The data source file is used to populate the linked
combo and the fields linked to it.

NOTE: When defining a linked combo, consider the following:

- You can define multiple linked combos for an object, provided that different attributes are used
  for the combos. For example, you define a linked combo for the user object using the company,
  department, and title attributes. To define another combo for the user object, you cannot use any
  of the previously used attributes.
- For two different object types, you can use the same attributes in different linked combos.

#### Linked Combo Data File

The linked combo requires an XML file that contains the data for the display type itself and the
other display types that will be linked to it. GroupID also supports the Microsoft Excel file format
(.xls or .xlsx), that it automatically converts to XML. The data in the Excel file must be in a
specific format for GroupID to process it.

For information about the Excel file format, see the
[Excel Data File Format](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
topic.

NOTE: If data in the source file is updated, you must reload the file for changes to take effect.

## Define a Linked Combo Display Type

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to define a custom display type for it.  
   All identity stores associated with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can
   design a different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Custom Display Types** in the left pane.
5. On the **Custom Display Types** page, click the **Linked Combo Types** tab.
6. Click **Add** to define a linked combo display type.
7. Complete the pages of the **Linked Combo Display Type** wizard.

   1. On the **Details** page, provide the source data file. See the
      [Linked Combo Type - Details](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
      topic for more info.
   2. On the **Schema** page, define the parent-child relationship between fields. See the
      [Linked Combo Type - Schema](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
      topic for details.

8. Click **OK**.
9. Click **Save** on the **Custom Display Types** page.  
   The linked combo display type is listed on the **Linked Combo Types** tab.

## Implement a Linked Combo

To use a linked combo in a portal, do the following:

1. Link a linked combo display type to a schema attribute on the **Search Forms**, **Properties**,
   **Create Object**, or **Property Validation** page in Design settings. The linked combo is
   rendered as a drop-down list in the portal.  
   On the **Schema** page of the **Linked Combo Display Type** wizard, you selected an expression
   (representing a data column in the source Excel workbook) in the **Type binding expression**
   drop-down list. Each record in this column will be displayed as a value in the drop-down list in
   the portal. When a user selects a value, it will be stored as the value of the schema attribute
   mapped to the linked combo display type.
2. The fields listed in the **Linked Field** list on the **Schema** page are already mapped to
   schema attributes. For all fields that you use in a linked combo, one of the following cases
   apply:

   - If a fieldâs schema attribute is already rendered as a field on the same portal page, it auto
     connects to the linked combo. Values in this field are displayed with respect to the
     expression mapped to it on the **Schema** page.  
     Letâs assume you select a field, Country, in the _Linked Field_ list, which is mapped to the
     âcoâ attribute in Active Directory. You link it to the âCountry Nameâ column in the source
     file. This column contains the names of all the countries in the world.  
     Now in the default portal template, the âcoâ attribute is already rendered as a drop-down list
     on the _General_ tab in user properties and displays the names of Asian countries. When you
     apply your linked combo (containing the Country field) on the General tab, it auto-connects to
     the âcoâ attribute and replaces its values (the list of Asian countries) with the values from
     the source data file (the names of all countries of the world).
   - If a fieldâs schema attribute is not previously used on the same portal page as the linked
     combo, the field will not be displayed in the portal. You must link this attribute to a
     display type and render it on the same portal page as the linked combo. Values in this field
     will be displayed with respect to the expression mapped to it on the **Schema** page.

   In any case, set the display type of each field in a linked combo to a _Textbox_ or _Dropdown_
   list, depending on the kind of values it would hold.

### Example Case for Implementing a Linked Combo

In this example, we will link a linked combo display type to the Company attribute (field) on the
General tab of the user properties page in the portal. Next, we will present how the fields used in
the linked combo should be rendered on the General tab, so that the fields are connected.

#### Step 1: Link a Linked Combo to a Schema Attribute

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings.**
4. In the left pane, click **Properties**.
5. On the **Properties** page, select _User_ in the **Select Directory Object** list.
6. The names of all tabs on the portalâs user properties page are listed under **Name**. To render
   the linked combo on the **General** tab, click **Edit** for it.
7. On the **Edit Design Category** pane, letâs link the _Company_ field to the linked combo. Click
   **Edit** for the _Company_ field.
8. On the **Edit Field** pane, select a schema attribute to map your linked combo to, and in the
   **Display Type** drop-down list, select your linked combo display type.
9. Click **OK** on the panes to close them.
10. Click **Save** on the **Custom Display Types** page.

The _Company_ field would be displayed as a drop-down list on the _General_ tab of the user
properties page in the portal. Values in this list will be populated from the comboâs source data
file, with respect to the expression selected in the **Type Binding Expression** drop-down list on
the **Linked Combo Display Type** wizard.

#### Step 2: Render the Linked Fields in the Combo on the Portal

If the fields defined in a linked combo are already rendered on the same portal page as the linked
combo, make sure that the appropriate display type is used for them. Some examples are shown in the
table below.

On the other hand, if the fields defined in a linked combo are not available on the same portal page
as the linked combo, you must create the fields first. These fields must be linked to the same
schema attributes as the comboâs fields are linked with, and an appropriate display type must be set
for them. The following table shows an example of the field names and the display types to set for
them.

| Field   | Display Type to use | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Country | Drop-down list      | Create a Drop-down List display type and use it for this field or use the default drop-down list, lstCountry. lstCountry has values defined for it, which may produce undesirable results.                                          |
| State   | Drop-down list      | Create a Drop-down List display type and use it for this field or use the default drop-down list, lstState.                                                                                                                         |
| City    | Drop-down list      | Create a Drop-down List display type and use it for this field or use the default drop-down list, lstCity.                                                                                                                          |
| Address | Text box            | Use a simple text box display type with this field.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Zip     | Text box            | Use a simple text box display type with this field or use the default textbox display type, maskZIPCode. This default display type comes with a validation check that ensures that users enter the zip code in the required format. |

## Reload the Source Data File

When you update data in the source file, you must also reload the file for changes to take effect.

**To reload the file:**

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to define a custom display type for it.  
   All identity stores associated with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can
   design a different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Custom Display Types** in the left pane.
5. On the **Custom Display Types** page, click the **Linked Combo Types** tab.
6. Click **Edit** for a linked combo to reload the source data file for it. The **Linked Combo
   Display Type** wizard is displayed.
7. On the **Details** page, click **Browse** to select the file to load. Then click **Next**.
8. On the **Schema** page, make changes to the relationships, if required, and click **OK**.  
   See the
   [Linked Combo Type - Schema](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
   topic for details.
9. Click **Save** on the **Custom Display Types** page.

## Linked Combo Type - Schema

On the **Schema** page of the **Linked Combo Display Type** wizard, define the parent-child
relationship between fields. Every linked field must have a parent field except the primary parent
field. Each linked field also requires a data binding expression that defines its mapping with the
underlying XML data. GroupID provides a list of all possible data binding expressions (extracted
from the XML source file) to select from.

Do the following:

1. Map the **Type binding expression** list to the first worksheet (0-`<worksheet name>`) of the
   source Excel workbook. The portal fields use the binding expression to obtain reference to the
   worksheet in the source file to retrieve and display data from.  
   Expressions in the **Type binding expression** list are auto generated with respect to the number
   of sheets in the source Excel workbook and the number of columns in a sheet. It is as:

   ![binding_expressions_examples](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/binding_expressions_examples.webp)

   In an expression, worksheet names are enclosed in brackets while the names of the data columns
   in the worksheets are without brackets. The expressions in the figure above indicate that the
   Excel workbook has three worksheets: _Company_, _Country_, and _City_.

   - The _Company_ worksheet has one data column: _Name_.
   - The _Country_ worksheet has two data columns: _Name_ and _State_.
   - The _City_ worksheet has four data columns: _Name_, _Address_, _Address2_, and _ZipCode_.

2. Use the grid on the **Schema** page to link and relate the data from the Excel workbook sheets to
   the portal fields.

   1. Click **Add** to add a row.

      ![child_fields](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/child_fields.webp)

   2. In the **Linked Field** drop-down list, select a field (for example, Country). This field
      will be linked to the data column represented by the binding expression you select in the
      **Binding Expression** drop-down list.  
      The **Linked Field** list contains predefined, hard coded fields, where each field is already
      mapped to a schema attribute. When you map a field to an expression, the values in the
      worksheetâs data column will be available for the field in the portal. When a portal user
      selects a value, it is set as the attributeâs value for the field.
   3. The **Parent Field** list does not apply to the first row. For all other rows, use it to
      select the name of the parent field for the selected linked field. For example, when _State_
      is selected in the _Linked Field_ list, select Country as the parent field.
   4. In the **Binding Expression** drop-down list, select an expression that represents the data
      column you want to link to the field selected in the **Linked Field** list.  
      Expressions are auto generated with respect to the number of sheets in the source Excel
      workbook and the number of columns in a sheet, as shown in the figure above.

   The following example shows the relationship for an Excel workbook with three worksheets:
   0-Company, 1-Country, and 2-City. (You can also create two linked combos to manage the
   relationship between these three fields.)

   ![schema](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/schema.webp)

   The relationship formed between fields can be explained as:

   - The Company field, containing all records from the Name column on the Company worksheet, will
     be the primary linked combo field in the portal.
   - The Country field in the portal will contain all records from the Name column on the Country
     worksheet.
   - The State field in the portal will contain all records from the State column on the Country
     worksheet. The Country field will be the parent field for the State field, which means that
     when a user selects a country, the State field will show the states in that country.
   - The City field in the portal will contain all records from the Name column on the City
     worksheet. The State field will be the parent field for the City field, which means that when
     a user selects a state, the City field will show the cities in the selected state.

   The complete structure for the data in the Excel workbook is explained in the following table.

   | Worksheet | Column                       | Description                                       | Example   |
   | --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
   | 0-Company | ID                           | Company identifier                                | 1000 2000 |
   | Name      | Company name                 | Netwrix Consulting Netwrix Software               |           |
   | 1-Country | FK                           | Company identifier with which to link this record | 1000 2000 |
   | ID        | Country identifier           | 1010 2010                                         |           |
   | Name      | Country name                 | United States Pakistan                            |           |

## Access Admin Center

Admin Center is a web-based application that can be accessed over the Internet and Intranet. It
comes with a default provider, _GroupID_, which primarily facilitates first-time login to the
application. Typically, the _GroupID_ provider has one default user, _Super Admin_, that has full
access to Admin Center. On signing in, this user can create identity stores and configure settings
to get the application ready for use.

## Sign In

You must connect Admin Center to an identity store while signing in.

Use any of the following methods to connect and sign in:

- Select an identity store and enter the username and password of your identity store account.

  NOTE: To sign in using the GroupID provider, enter the username and password you specified for
  _GroupID Administrator_ on the **Service Account Settings** page of the Configuration Tool. See
  the
  [Configure a new GroupID server with a new or an existing database](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/getting-started/installation/post-installation.md)
  topic.

- Select an identity store and sign in using a SAML provider.  
  (This option is available if a SAML provider is configured with the selected identity store.)

  NOTE: Microsoft Entra ID MFAÂ enabled users cannot log into GroupID using their username and
  password. They will be authenticated through the SAML provider configured for in GroupID.

- Scan the displayed QR code with the GroupID app installed on your smartphone.  
  (This option is available if the QR code feature is enabled for the identity store you want to
  connect to.)

Next, you may have to pass second factor authentication, depending on whether it is enabled for your
role in the identity store. You can perform tasks in Admin Center in keeping with your role and
permissions in the identity store.

**To sign in:**

1. Type the Admin Center URL in the address bar of a web browser and press Enter. For example:  
   https://[machine name]:4443//AdminCenter

   Or

   On the Windows Start menu, search for the GroupID 11.0 icon and double-click it to launch Admin
   Center in a browser window.

2. You can sign in using any of the following methods:

   - [With your Identity Store Account](#with-your-identity-store-account)
   - [With a SAML Provider](#with-a-saml-provider)
   - [With QR Code](#with-qr-code)

### With your Identity Store Account

1. On the **GroupID Authenticate** page, click an identity store to connect to.
2. In the **Username** and **Password** boxes, enter the username and password of your identity
   store account, or click **Edit** next to the identity store name to connect to a different
   identity store.
3. After providing your credentials, click **Sign In**.

### With a SAML Provider

You can opt for single sign-on across all GroupID clients, provided that a SAML provider is
configured with GroupID. See the following topics for additional information on the SAML provider
configuration:

- [Configure GroupID in Microsoft Entra ID for SSO](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/configuration/authentication/third-party-providers.md)
- [Configure the Microsoft Entra SSO Application in GroupID](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/configuration/authentication/third-party-providers.md)

On the **GroupID Authenticate** page, click the button or image for the provider and proceed to sign
in.

NOTE: For Microsoft Entra ID MFAÂ enabled users, a SAML provider must be configured for signing into
GroupID.

### With QR Code

If QR code is enabled for any of the identity stores, the **GroupID Authenticate** page displays the
code too. Use the QR code to sign into an identity store.

1. Open the GroupID app on your smartphone and connect to an identity store. This identity store
   should have the QR code feature enabled for it.  
   Admin Center would connect to the same identity store you connect the app to.
2. Tap **Configure Application Using QR Code** in the app.
3. Capture the QR code through the app on your phone. One of the following happens:

   - If the identity store that the app is connected to does not have the QR code option enabled,
     an error message is displayed.
   - If the identity store that the app is connected to has the QR code option enabled, Admin
     Center will connect to this identity store.

### Pass Second Factor Authentication

The administrator can enable second factor authentication for a security role in an identity store.

If enabled for your role in the identity store, you must pass second factor authentication after
signing in via any of the above methods.

For second factor authentication, one of the following applies:

- If you have not enrolled your identity store account in GroupID, the **Enroll Account** page is
  displayed. You must enroll using at least one authentication type. See the
  [Enroll with Authentication Types](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.
- If you have already enrolled your identity store account in GroupID, the **Authenticate** page is
  displayed. It lists the authentication type(s) your account is enrolled with. Select an
  authentication type to authenticate. See the
  [Authenticate with Authentication Types](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/index.md)
  topic.

## Sign Out

In Admin Center, click your name in the top right corner and select **Sign Out**.

## View the GroupID Version

You can view the GroupID 11 version deployed in your environment.

In Admin Center, click your name in the top right corner; the menu displays the running GroupID
version.

## Modern Authentication Support

When you create the GroupID app in Microsoft Entra Admin Center, you have to bind a certificate to
it. Export that certificate to PFX form.

For modern authentication, GroupID requires this PFXÂ certificate to communicate with the GroupID app
in Microsoft Entra Admin Center.

In GroupID, you must provide this PFX certificate on the following pages:

- In Identity store connection settings while creating a Microsoft Entra ID identity store.
- In messaging provider settings (when Exchange Online / Office 365 is set as messaging provider).
- When you select AD as destination and Office 365 as messaging provider in a Synchronize job, you
  have to provide the certificate on the Sync Object page.

### OAuth Notifications

While configuring an SMTP server for an identity store, you can choose to provide OAuth notification
settings.

### Modern Authentication and gMSA Permissions

To use a gMSA as service account for GroupID services and app pool, do the following:

1. Add the gMSA account to the membership of the _IIS_IUSRS_ group on the GroupID server.
2. Then, add the _IIS_IUSRS_ group in the âManage Private Keysâ permission for the certificate that
   GroupID uses for modern authentication.
