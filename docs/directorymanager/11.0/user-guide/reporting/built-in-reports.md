# Reports

The GroupID Reports enables you to generate web-based reports for an identity store. It offers a
wizard guided report generation process that accounts for quick and easy reporting.

GroupID reports are organized into four categories:

- [User Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/reporting/built-in-reports.md)
- [Group Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/reporting/built-in-reports.md)
- [Computer Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/reporting/built-in-reports.md)
- [Contact Reports](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/reporting/built-in-reports.md)

NOTE: A Microsoft Entra ID based identity store does not support the computer and contact object
types.

You can view, edit, and delete the created reports. You can also download them in Excel and PDF
formats.

The user interface of Reports Dashboard is as follows:

![reportsdashboard](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/portal/report/reportsdashboard.webp)

Different elements of the Dashboard are described below:

- Look on the top of the page for Reports Search. Use it to locate and display information for
  reports.
- In the top right corner, you will find the following icons:

- The **Dashboard** displays general information about the Reports portal such as:

  - Name of the identity store the Reports portal is connected to.
  - Name of the domain.
  - Number of each type directory objects in the directory.

- In the **Pinned Reports** section, you can pin the reports you most frequently will use.

  You can unpin the pinned reports from the dashboard by clicking the unpin icon on the top right
  corner of the card.

# Generate Reports

Generating reports in GroupID Portal is a two step process that makes the reporting process quick
and easy. The steps for generating a report are the same for all reports; you have to specify
settings, such as the source container or organizational unit, the field to sort all records, and
the display names for the fields in the report.

After generating a report, you can download it in different formats such as Excel, PDF, and HTML.

You can generate a report in any of the two ways:

- Use the Create Report option.
- Use a Scheduled Reports job.

Of these, the last method can only be used for a report that has previously been generated.

What do you want to do?

- [Create a Report](#create-a-report)
- [Scheduled Report job](#scheduled-report-job)

## Create a Report

Reports are generated for the domain that your machine is joined to. For example, when your machine
is joined to a domain, techwr5.local, reports would display data for techwr5.local.

**To generate a report:**

1. In GroupID Portal, select **Reports** from the left pane.
2. On Reports Portal, select the type of objects whose report you want to generate. It will display
   the reports templates for that object.

   For example, to create a user report, click **User Report** from left pane. You will see all the
   user reports that you can generate.

3. Click on the template of your choice from the list and click **Create Report**.
4. In **Step 1** of generating a report:

   1. You can specify a custom title for your report. Type the title of the report, replacing the
      existing one, in the **Report Name** box.
   2. Click **Browse** to open the **Select Container** dialog box and select the required source
      container. The default selection is the Global Catalog.
   3. Select the **Include sub containers** check box to include the sub-containers for the
      selected container when reporting.
   4. In the **Filter Criteria** section, modify the default LDAP filter as required. This filter
      is used for selecting items from the container, to display in the report.

      To add additional filter, click **Add More Filters.**

   5. Click **Next**.

5. In **Step 2** of generating a report:

   1. The **Fields** section displays the fields that will be included in the report. You can add
      or remove fields from the list. You can also move the given fields to change their order.
   2. From **Sort By** drop down list, select the field by which you want to sort the results in
      the report.
   3. From **Schedule** drop down list, select the schedule for the report. If you select a
      schedule, the report will run automatically on the specified time of the schedule.
   4. Click **Finish.**

      Report based on the setting you set on the portal is displayed. The report displays the
      following information:

      1. Connected identity store name
      2. The selected container
      3. Number of the records fetched
      4. Date the report was created on
      5. The filter applied while creating the report
      6. List of the report results

      The report is then listed in the template's page. You can create multiple reports of the
      same template.

6. To download the report, click **Download** and select the format for the report (PDF, Excel, or
   HTML).
7. You can also pin the report on Dashboard by clicking **Pin Report**.

## Scheduled Report job

You can create a **Scheduled Report job** on GroupID Admin Center. See
[Reports Schedule](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/administration/admin-center/system-settings.md)
