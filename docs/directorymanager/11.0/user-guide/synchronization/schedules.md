# Create a Job Collection

A job collection is a group of individual jobs that you want to run in a particular order. For
instance, you can create a job collection to synchronize user accounts between multiple Active
Directory domains. You first create multiple Synchronize jobs to transfer data between two
directories, and then combine them in a job collection. Then you can execute the job collection
instead of executing each job one by one.

To understand how workflows work with Synchronize jobs, see the
[Synchronize Jobs and Workflows](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/workflows/approval-workflows.md#synchronize-jobs-and-workflows)
topic.

   the job collection from scratch.
4. Click **Next Step**
5. On the
   [Synchronized Job Collection](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/synchronization/schedules.md)
   page, add jobs to the collection. You can either add existing jobs or create new jobs to add them
   to the job collection.
6. On the
   [Scheduling and Notifications](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/synchronization/schedules.md)
   page, choose a schedule for a job collection and set up notification settings.

   NOTE: After creating the job collection, you can modify the schedule for the job collection and

   executing it.
8. To review the information and changes regarding the job collection, click **Review Your Change**
   at the bottom.
9. Click **Finish** to exit the wizard and create the job collection.
10. Once you run the job collection, the job collection runs and only those jobs will process for
    which workflow is not configured. If workflow is configured for any job, the request gets
    generated against that specific job.
11. Generated workflow request will be displayed in the
    "[Requests](/docs/directorymanager/11.0/user-guide/workflows/approval-workflows.md)" section for the
    workflow approver(s). If the approver approves the workflow request, the job will execute the
    results.
12. **Run Job Collection** dialog box displays overall collection statistics for the run, reports
    and individual logs for each job in the collection.

   - **One or more errors occur**: Send a notification only when errors occur while executing the
     job collection.
