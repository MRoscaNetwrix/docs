What do you want to do?

- [Run the Preparation Tool first time on a fresh machine](#run-the-preparation-tool-first-time-on-a-fresh-machine)
- [Run the Preparation Tool on an existing GroupID server](#run-the-preparation-tool-on-an-existing-groupidserver)

## Run the Preparation Tool first time on a fresh machine

To run the GroupID preparation tool:

1. Open **GroupID 11 Prerequisites Tool** folder from the GroupID Installation package.
2. Run _directorymanagerPrereqTool.exe_ file. It launches the Preparation Tool.

   ![Preparation Tool Welcome page](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/install/installer/welcome.webp)

3. Read the welcome message and click **Next**.

   ![Ready to Begin page](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/install/installer/ready_to_begin.webp)

4. The **Ready to begin** page lists the required software and Windows features that the Preparation
   Tool has identified for GroupID.  
   Click **Install** to begin.

   ![We are preparing page](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/install/installer/wearepreparing.webp)

5. On the **We are preparing this machine for GroupID ...** page the progress bar shows the
   installation progress while prerequisites are installed.

   ![Ready to install](/img/versioned_docs/directorymanager_11.0/directorymanager/install/installer/ready_to_install.webp)

   The **You are ready to install GroupID!** page displays the status of each prerequisite software
   and Windows feature as _Passed_ or _Failed_.

   Expand the node for a perquisite to view its details.

   - A Passed prerequisite has one of these statuses:

     - was already installed (no action taken)
     - Configured Successfully

   - For a Failed prerequisite, read the given message and take appropriate action. That done,
     click **Retry** to verify whether the prerequisite has been installed.

6. After viewing the information, click **Close**.

   If you are installing the prerequisites for the first time, a message to restart the machine is
   displayed. Click **OK** to restart.

## Run the Preparation Tool on an existing GroupID server

If you have an earlier version of GroupID 11.0 installed on a machine, then before running the
preparation tool make sure no other version of the following prerequisite than the mentioned below
is installed, otherwise uninstall them manually:

- Microsoft .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.30
- Microsoft ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle 6.0.30
- Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016
- Microsoft Access Database Engine version later to 2016
- PowerShell 7.3.6
- Exchange Online Management versions from 3.2.0 to 3.4.0

  If a higher version is installed, uninstall that using the following cmdlet:

  `uninstal-Module-Name exchangeonlinemanagement -force`

- Microsoft Edge Webview2 Rnntime

  NOTE: If you need to re-run the preparation tool, uninstall this component first.

After uninstalling the prerequisites, follow the steps given in the
[Run the Preparation Tool first time on a fresh machine](#run-the-preparation-tool-first-time-on-a-fresh-machine)
section above.

When Elasticsearch is locked, any object created or modified in GroupID will be committed in provider but not in the Elasticsearch repository. NOTE: While configuring an Elasticsearch cluster on all GroupID Instances, make sure that port TCP IP 9305 or a custom port (configured in the yml file for the Elasticsearch cluster) is unblocked and remains the same on each GroupID instance that is part of the master-slave cluster. NOTE: If you do not want to use this version of Elasticsearch, select the **I will install and manage Elasicsearch myself** option on the Elasticsearch Settings page of the Configuration Tool.                                                                                                                                                                         |

Both systems must have WinRM configured (use the PowerShell command winrm /quickconfig for this). The default value for the necessary listener(s) is \* and that is all that is necessary to make a remote connection when the “–authentication” parameter is not specified. - **Option 2: Inter-Domain** Both systems must have WinRM configured (use the PowerShell command winrm /quickconfig for this). Design the hosts to trust each other by configuring “Trusted Hosts” either by GPO or locally. - By GPO — Computer > Windows > Admin Templates > Windows Components > Windows Remote Management > WinRM Client > Trusted Hosts - Use this PowerShell command to configure locally: Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts –Value `<servername.domain.com>` |
