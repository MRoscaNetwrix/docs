# Configure Directory Manager in Microsoft Entra ID

In Directory Manager, you can create an identity store for an identity provider and perform
different functions in that provider using its identity store. These functions include group
management tasks, such as creating groups, scheduling group updates, and expiring groups; user
management tasks, such as creating users and mailboxes, managing usersâ€™ profiles, and more.

Directory Manager supports multiple identity providers for creating an identity store, including
Microsoft Entra ID, formerly Azure Active Directory. This section provides information that will
help configure Directory Manager in Microsoft Entra ID.
