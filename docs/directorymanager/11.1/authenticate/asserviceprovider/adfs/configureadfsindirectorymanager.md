# Configure the AD FS Provider In Directory Manager

To configure a SAML provider in Directory Manager, you have to specify the following:

- Issuer URL
- IDP Login URL
- Token signing certificate
- An image for the identity provider
- Advanced configurations

## Configure the AD FS Provider in Directory Manager

Follow the steps to configure the AD FS provider in Directory Manager.

Step 1 – In Directory Manager Authenticate, click the **SAML Providers** tab.

Step 2 – On the SAML Providers page, click **New Provider**.

Step 3 – On the Create New Provider page, enter a name for the provider.

Step 4 – Make sure the Client box displays the name of the Directory Manager client for which you
generated the Entity ID/Audience URL and provided that in AD FS.  
Keep this page open while we copy configurations from AD FS and provide them here.

## Provide Issuer URL

The issuer URL is provided by the federation service, i.e., AD FS. Copy this URL from AD FS and
provide it in Directory Manager.

Step 1 – In the AD FS console, right-click **Service** and select **Edit Federation Service
Properties**.

Step 2 – On the Federation Service Properties dialog box, copy the URL displayed in the Federation
Service Identifier box and paste it in the Issuer box on the Create New Provider page in Directory
Manager.

### Provide IDP Login URL

The IDP Login URL is the URL of the AD FS sign-in page. Follow the steps to fetch and enter IDP
Login URL.

Step 1 – Launch the AD FS login page and copy the URL displayed in the address bar.

Step 2 – We only need the initial part of the URL, up to _ls_. Copy it and paste it in the IDP Login
URL box on the Create New Provider page.

### Get Token-Signing Certificate

The next step is to get the token-signing certificate from AD FS and provide it in Directory
Manager. Follow the steps to do so.

Step 1 – Go to the AD FS console and click **Certificates**. The certificates are displayed.

Step 2 – Double-click the token-signing certificate to open its properties.

Step 3 – On the Certificate Properties dialog box, go to the Details tab and click the **Copy to
File** button to launch the Certificate Export Wizard.

Step 4 – Read the welcome message and click **Next**.

Step 5 – On the Export File Format page, select the **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)** option button
and click **Next**.

Step 6 – On the File to Export page, specify a name for the certificate file and click **Browse** to
specify a location to save it. Then click **Next**.

Step 7 – On the next page, click **Finish** to complete the wizard.

Step 8 – Open the certificate file in Notepad and select the entire content. Copy this certificate
and paste it in the IDP Certificate box on the Create New Provider page in Directory Manager. Make
sure there is no trailing space after the dashes that mark the end of the certificate.

### Upload an Image for the Identity Provider

When AD FS is configured with a Directory Manager client, say the Directory Manager portal _Wizard_,
it will be available on _Wizard’s_ login page for single sign-on. You can choose to display the AD
FS option as an image or as a button.

To display the AD FS option as an image, you have to upload an image for it. On the Create New
Provider page, use the Browse button under Identity Provider Image to upload an image for AD FS.

NOTE: Supported image formats: .jpg, .bmp, .webp, .gif  
Required image file dimensions: 210 x 60 pixels

If you do not upload an image, AD FS authentication will be shown as a button. This button would
have the same name as you entered in the Name box on the Create New Provider page.

Users can click the AD FS image or the button on the login page of the Directory Manager portal
_Wizard_ for single sign-on.

### Specify Advanced Configurations

Next, specify some advanced configurations for the identity provider. Expand the Advanced section on
the Create New Provider page and provide the information as follows:

Step 1 – Make sure that _RSA-SHA-256_ is selected in the Response Signing Method box.

Step 2 – The Disable GroupID Authentication option indicates whether to display the Directory
Manager authentication login on the Directory Manager client's login page ( i.e., Wizard portal’s
login page in our example).

- By default, ‘No’ is selected, which means that when users access the Directory Manager client's
  login page, they will be shown the Directory Manager login and password option along with the
  identity provider’s button.
- Selecting ‘Yes’ means that the Directory Manager login and password option will not be available
  on the Directory Manager client's login page. Moreover, when a single identity store and a single
  SAML provider is configured, the login page for the provider is displayed rather than the
  Directory Manager client's login page.

Step 3 – Select _Post_ in the Request Binding drop-down list.  
To verify that you have selected the correct binding type, do the following:

1. In the AD FS console click **Relying Party Trust** in the left pane; the middle pane displays the
   relying party trusts already configured.
2. Double-click the relying party trust that you created for the Directory Manager portal _Wizard_.
   This launches the Properties dialog box for the relying party trust.
3. Click the **Endpoints** tab and confirm that the binding type is _POST_.

Step 4 – In AD FS, we configured an Active Directory attribute that the identity provider will use
for authenticating users (see step 16 in the
[Configure Relaying Party Trust in AD FS](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/authenticate/asserviceprovider/adfs/configurerelayingpartytrust.md) topic). In our example, we
used the UPN attribute that stores the user principal name. Now in the Advanced section, we have to
refer to this attribute.  
In the Identity Location list, select the _Identity is an attribute element_ option.

Step 5 – On selecting it, the Identity Location Attribute box is displayed.  
The attribute location will be in the form of a URL. Get this URL from AD FS.

1. In the AD FS console, click **Claim Descriptions** in the left pane and then select the Active
   Directory attribute you specified for authentication. In our example, it is the UPN attribute.
2. Double-click the attribute to open its properties.
3. On the Attribute Properties dialog box, copy the URL displayed in the Claim type box and paste it
   in the Identity Location Attribute box.

Step 6 – With all configurations completed, click the **Create Provider** button. The identity
provider, i.e., AD FS, is created and displayed on the SAML Providers page.
