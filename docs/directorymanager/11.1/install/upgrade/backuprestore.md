GroupID when upgrading to Directory Manager 11.1.

- Database on SQL Server

## Database on SQL Server

```
ldifde -f c:\groupinfobeforedirectorymanager.ldf -r "(&(objectClass=group)(objectCategory=group)(|(extensionData=*)(extensionAttribute15=*)(extensionAttribute14=*)(extensionAttribute13=*)(extensionAttribute12=*)" -p Subtree -l extensionData,extensionAttribute15,extensionAttribute14,extensionAttribute13,extensionAttribute12
