# Change your Password

You can change the password of your identity store account. After changing it, use the new password
to sign into Directory Manager and other applications that use your domain account.

You can change password according to the password policy the administrator has enabled for the
identity store. The administrator can either enable
[Directory Manage Password Policy ](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/securityrole/policy/password.md) or Netwrix Password Policy
Enforcer policies for the identity store.

## Change your Password

Follow the steps to change your password.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click your name in the top right corner and select **Change Password**.

Step 2 – On the Change Password page, enter your current password in the **Current Password** box.  
By default, password characters are represented by dots. Use the toggle button in the box to show or
hide characters.

Step 3 – Enter a new password in the **New Password** and **Confirm Password** boxes. The new
password must conform to the rules of the applied password policy for the identity store.

Step 4 – Click **Change Password**.
