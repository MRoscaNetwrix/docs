# Manage the Global Question Pool

Directory Manager provides a list of predefined security questions for enrollment and
authentication. You can update this list by adding or removing questions.

When an identity store is created, four questions from this global pool are automatically added to
the identity store's local question pool. This pool is not shared with other identity stores.
