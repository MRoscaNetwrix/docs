# GroupID Entitlement Schedule

An Entitlement schedule is automatically created for an identity store when:

- A server is added for permission analysis on the Entitlement page in an Active Directory identity
  store. See the [Manage File Servers](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/entitlement/ad/manage.md) for additional information on
  adding a server.

    Or

- A SharePoint site is added for permission analysis on the Entitlement page in a Microsoft Entra ID
  identity store. See the [Manage SharePoint Sites](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/entitlement/entraid/manage.md) topic for
  additional information on adding a SharePoint site.

By default, the schedule runs weekly to compute permissions on shared files and folders residing on
the specified servers (for Active Directory), and the document libraries present in the specified
sites (for SharePoint). It then replicates these permissions to Elasticsearch, enabling users to
view, manage and update these permissions in the Directory Manager portal.

On the very first run of the Entitlement schedule, it computes all permissions from scratch and
performs a complete replication. On each next run, it will create a parallel index for that specific
server/SharePoint site index with the suffix \_replication which computes all permissions from
scratch. In the meantime, user can perform actions on Directory Manager Entitlement. The actions
performed during this parallel replication are committed directly at the provider and stored in the
database. These changes are then immediately committed to elastic after the replication is complete.

The scope schedule changes are replicated after the new index is done replicating permissions from
the server/SharePoint. When this parallel index gets completely replicated, it becomes the new
primary index for this server/SharePoint site and the \_replication index is deleted from indices.

The GroupID Entitlement schedule runs in the context of the following accounts:

- For file servers, the schedule runs in the context of the service account defined for the identity
  store. In case you specify a different account for a file server, the schedule runs in the context
  of the changed account. See the
  [Connect to a File Server Using a Different Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/entitlement/ad/manage.md#connect-to-a-file-server-using-a-different-account)
  topic.
- For a SharePoint site, the schedule runs in the context of the account you specified to connect to
  the SharePoint admin site. In case you specify a different account for a site, the schedule runs
  in the context of the changed account. See the
  [Connect to a Site Using a Different Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/entitlement/entraid/manage.md#connect-to-a-site-using-a-different-account)
  topic.

You cannot create or delete a GroupID Entitlement schedule; only edit the existing schedule.

## Update the Schedule

Follow the steps to update the GroupID Entitlement schedule.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.

Step 2 – On the Identity Stores page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
**Edit**.

Step 3 – Click **Schedules** under Settings in the left pane.

Step 4 – On the Schedules page, click the plus sign next to **GroupID Entitlement**. Then click the
ellipsis button for the schedule and select **Edit**.

Step 5 – On the Edit Schedule page, the Schedule Name and Name Preview boxes display the name of the
schedule as read-only. The name format is
`_Entitlement_<the name of the machine the schedule is created on>`.

Step 6 – In the Scheduler Service Name drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on the
number of nodes in all Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each node has its own Scheduler
service. See the [Scheduler Service](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/service/schedulerservice.md) topic for additional
information.

Please note the following while selecting a Scheduler service:

- The Scheduler service for the Directory Manager instance on which you are creating the schedule is
  selected by default. However, you can select the Scheduler service of another instance as well.

- The Scheduler service can be changed even after creating the schedule. Upon the next run, the
  schedule will be triggered by the newly-selected Scheduler service.

- If the selected Scheduler service fails to trigger the schedule, then no other Scheduler service
  can be selected automatically.

- If a schedule is run manually on the Admin Center, then the Scheduler service of that instance
  will be used.

Step 7 – The **Triggers** area displays the default triggering frequency for the schedule.

- To change a trigger, click **Edit** for it.
- To add a new trigger, click **Add Trigger**.

Step 8 – Follow step 11 in the
[Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
topic to manage triggers.

Step 9 – After making the changes, click **Update Schedule**.

Step 10 – On the Schedules page, click **Save**.
