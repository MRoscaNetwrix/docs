# Replication Service

The Replication service replicates the attributes of the following objects from the provider (such
as Active Directory) to the Elasticsearch repository.

- Group
- User
- Contact
- Computers
- Organizational Unit

For more on the Replication service, see the
[Elasticsearch and Replication ](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/replication/overview.md)topic for additional information.

The service is also responsible for syncing data between the Elasticsearch clusters in your
environment.

## View Replication Service Details

Follow the steps to view Replication Service details.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.

Step 2 – On the **Applications** page, click the **Service** tab.  
The tab displays the default Replication service hosted in native IIS. When multiple Directory
Manager instances have been deployed, you will find multiple default Replication services on this
tab page, as each instance has its own default Replication service. See the
[Elasticsearch Clusters, Nodes, and Directory Manager](overview.md#elasticsearch-clusters-nodes-and-directory-manager)
topic for additional information.  
For details displayed on a service card, see the table in the
[View Data Service Details](dataservice/manage.md#view-data-service-details) topic.

You cannot create a Replication Service or delete an existing one from Admin Center.

## Manage Replication Service Settings

You can manage the following settings for a Replication service.

- [Change a Service’s Display Name](dataservice/manage.md#change-a-services-display-name)
- [Start or Stop a Service](dataservice/manage.md#start-or-stop-a-service)
- [View the Deployment Settings for a Service](dataservice/manage.md#view-the-deployment-settings-for-a-service)
- [Specify Log Settings for a Service](dataservice/manage.md#specify-log-settings-for-a-service)

## Enable Elastic Cluster Syncing

In an environment with multiple Elasticsearch clusters, you can choose to sync data between
clusters. You can also specify an interval for syncing.

NOTE: In Directory Manager, a separate Replication service is created for each node in a cluster. To
enable data syncing between clusters, simply enable the sync option for one Replications service
within each cluster.

Follow the steps to sync data between clusters.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.

Step 2 – On the Applications page, click the **Replication Service** tab.

Step 3 – Click the ellipsis button for a service and select **Settings**.

Step 4 – Click **Configurations** under Server Settings.

Step 5 – On the Configurations page, enable the **Elastic Cluster Syncing** toggle button to sync
data from all other clusters to the cluster that uses this Replication service.  
If this toggle button is disabled for a cluster (say, ClusterA), data from other clusters will not
be synced to ClusterA.  
Suppose syncing is disabled for ClusterA but enabled for ClusterB and ClusterC. This means that (a)
data from ClusterB and ClusterC will not be synced to ClusterA (b) data from ClusterA will be synced
to ClusterB and ClusterC.

Step 6 – You can specify an interval for syncing data. Click **Edit** under Elastic Cluster Syncing
Interval, specify an interval (in seconds) and click the check mark.  
By default, the interval is set to 5 seconds. You can specify a maximum interval of 900 seconds.

Step 7 – Click **Save**.
