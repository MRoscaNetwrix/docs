# Configure History Tracking

In Directory Manager, history for an identity store is tracked at two levels:

- **When objects are created, modified, and deleted** - When you enable history tracking for an
  identity store, Directory Manager tracks all actions that are committed to the directory using:

    - Directory Manager portal (whether manually, through Synchronize jobs. or changes to object
      entitlements)
    - Management Shell cmdlets
    - Admin Center (actions performed by schedules only)
    - APIs

    You can choose to track specific actions, such as ownership change and object deletion. The
    table in the Track Specific Actions for an Identity Store topic lists some individual actions
    available for tracking.

    Use the _History_ node in the Directory Manager portal to view the history data that the history
    tracking function collects for objects. History for individual objects is also displayed in the
    respective object’s properties.

- **When changes are made to an identity store’s configurations** - Directory Manager enables you to
  track the changes made to an identity store’s configurations, which include the following:

    - identity store properties
    - workflows
    - security roles

    See the [Identity Store History](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/identitystore/view/view.md) topic to view the tracked history data.

By default, history tracking is disabled. You can:

- Enable the history tracking function for an identity store.
- Track all or specific actions.
- Specify a period for retaining history data in the Directory Manager database. When the period is
  over, data is exported to CSV files and deleted from the database.

:::info
History tracking can slow down system performance. For optimal performance, it is
recommended that you track only specific, more important actions and limit Directory Manager history
data storage to the most recent records.

See the [History in Directory Manager](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/general/history.md) and
[Event Logging](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/admincenter/identitystore/view/eventlogging.md) topics for additional information.

What do you want to do?

- Enable History Tracking for All Actions
- Track Specific Actions for an Identity Store
- Retain Complete History Data
- Retain History for a Specific Period
- Disable History Tracking

## Enable History Tracking for All Actions

You can choose to enable or disable history tracking for an identity store. When enabled, all
actions that users perform on directory objects using Directory Manager are tracked by default. For
example, when a user creates a group, adds members to it, changes its expiry date, and assigns
owners, history logs are generated in Directory Manager. Moreover, changes made to identity store
configurations, workflows, and security roles are also tracked.

**To enable history tracking:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **History**.
4. Use the toggle button in the top right corner to enable or disable history tracking for the
   identity store.

    - On enabling, _All Actions_ is auto selected in the **Track** drop-down list. This indicates
      that (a) all actions that users perform on directory objects and (b) changes made to identity
      store configurations, workflows, and security roles are tracked for the identity store.  
      To track specific actions, see the Track Specific Actions for an Identity Store topic.
    - Disabling history tracking does not delete already recorded history data.

5. Click **Save**.

## Track Specific Actions for an Identity Store

Rather than tracking all actions for an identity store, you can choose to track the most important
actions, such as changes to a group’s primary owner and object creation.

**To track specific actions:**

1. In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.
2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
3. Click **Configurations** under **Settings** in the left pane. Then click **History**.
4. On the **History** page, make sure history tracking is enabled. Them select _Selected Actions_ in
   the **Track** drop-down list. This enables the **Actions** area, where the following actions are
   listed:

    | Action                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

5. Click **Save**.

## Retain History for a Specific Period

You can set Directory Manager to retain an identity store's history data for a specified length of
time in the database. When the retention period is over, the History Retention schedule archives

2. On the **Identity Stores** page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
   **Edit**.
