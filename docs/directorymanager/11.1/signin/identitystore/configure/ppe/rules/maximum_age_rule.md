# Age (Max) Rule

The Maximum Age rule forces users to change their passwords regularly. This decreases the likelihood
of an attacker discovering a password before it changes. This rule can only be enforced by PPE
policies.

- Enable/Disable button – Enable the **Age (Max)** rule button to enable the Maximum Age rule.

- Users must change password after days – Choose a value from the drop-down list to specify how many
  days must elapse before passwords expire.

- Delay expiration by `<_number of days_>` if the password contains `<_number of characters_>` or
  more characters – You can encourage users to choose longer passwords by extending the lifetime of
  their password if it exceeds a certain length. To enable this feature, choose a higher value from
  the number of days drop-down list and a minimum length from the number of characters drop-down
  list. Passwords that contain the required number of characters do not expire until the number of
  days (higher) days value. If both days values (i.e. number of days in Users must change password
  after days and number of days in this in this field) are identical, then passwords will expire
  after the specified number of days, irrespective of length.

    NOTE: When the Maximum Age rule is configured to delay the expiry of longer passwords, it
    creates an Active Directory security group called "PPE Extended Maximum Age Users". Password
    Policy Enforcer uses this group to identify which users are eligible for a delayed password
    expiry. Users are added and removed from the group automatically. You can move and rename this
    group, but do not change the pre-Windows 2000 name. Contact Netwrix support if you must change
    the pre-Windows 2000 name. Change a Password Policy Enforcer configuration setting (any setting)
    after moving or renaming the group to trigger a cache update in Password Policy Enforcer.
    Password Policy Enforcer recreates this group if you delete it. To stop creating a group, make
    the two days values equal in all policies.

- Mode – Mode Choose a value from the Mode drop-down list to specify how Password Policy Enforcer
  handles expired passwords. The Standard mode forces all users with expired passwords to change
  their password during logon. The Transitional modes force a percentage of users with expired
  passwords to change their password during logon. The Warning mode warns users that their password
  has expired without forcing them to change it.

    Use the Warning and Transitional modes to gradually introduce a new password policy. These modes
    reduce the number of forced password changes, allowing the help desk to deal with any extra
    calls relating to the new policy. Switch to the Standard mode after most users have had a chance
    to change their password.

    It takes approximately 50 days for all users with expired passwords to be forced to change them
    in the 2% Transitional mode (2% every day). The 5% Transitional mode reduces this to 20 days,
    and the 10% Transitional mode further reduces it to 10 days. The selection algorithm is
    randomized, so these are estimates only. You must switch to the Standard mode to ensure that all
    old passwords will expire.

    Users with expired passwords are always prompted to change their password, even in the
    Transitional and Warning modes. Users can ignore the prompt to change their password unless they
    are being forced to change it.

    NOTE: The password expiry prompt is a Windows client feature, and is displayed even if the
    Password Policy Client is not installed. Windows clients display the prompt 5 days before
    passwords expire by default. You can alter this behavior in the Windows Group Policy security
    settings. See the
    [Interactive logon: Prompt user to change password before expiration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-prompt-user-to-change-password-before-expiration)
    Microsoft article for additional information.

    Password Policy Enforcer expires passwords at 1:00 AM every day on the domain controller holding
    the PDC emulator operations master role. It sets "User must change password at next logon" for
    users whose password has expired, or is due to expire on that day. Password Policy Enforcer does
    not expire passwords if the Maximum Age rule is in Warning mode, or for users with "Password
    never expires" set in Active Directory. Some passwords will not expire immediately when the
    Maximum Age rule is in a Transitional mode.
