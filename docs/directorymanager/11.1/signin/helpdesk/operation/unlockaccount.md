# Unlock Accounts

Administrators can enforce an account lockout policy for a domain that locks a user account after a
certain number of failed login attempts. This secures a machine from unauthorized access. However,
legitimate users may also get locked out; typically because of a typo or they could not recall their
password correctly.

In such a situation as this, helpdesk users can unlock user accounts in an identity store.

Helpdesk may have to authenticate users before unlocking their accounts. See the
[Helpdesk Policy ](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/signin/helpdesk/overview.md#helpdesk-policy) topic.

NOTE: You can unlock the account of unenrolled users if (a) the **Unlock Any Account** permission
has been granted to your role and (b) the Helpdesk policy for your role is set to the unrestricted
mode.

## Unlock User Accounts in Unrestricted Mode

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click **Helpdesk** in the left pane.

Step 2 – The Helpdesk page opens to the Helpdesk Operations tab. Locate your required user. To
search for a user, see the[Search Users](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/signin/helpdesk/operation/search.md) topic.

Step 3 – Click the ellipsis button for the user and select **Unlock Account**. For enrolled users,
the Unlock Account dialog box has two pages: Authenticate and Unlock. Under the unrestricted mode,
you can skip the former and move to the **Unlock** page. For unenrolled users, only the Unlock page
is available.  
Use the **History** button to view user history, i.e., the actions performed on the user and by the
user. This history is specific to helpdesk functions, as listed in the
[History in Helpdesk](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/signin/helpdesk/history.md) topic.

Step 4 – The Unlock page displays the user name, the identity store where this user resides, the
last time the user changed his or her password, and the lock status of the account. In case the user
has linked his or her accounts that exist in different identity stores, this page displays all
linked accounts that are locked.  
To unlock an account, select the check box for it and click **Unlock**.
