```
Upgrade-Group  
[-IdentityStoreId <int>] 
[-SearchContainer <List[string]>] 
[-SearchContainerScopeList <List[int]>] 
[-Identity <List[string]>] 
[-GroupType <List[int]>]

[-SecurityToken <CustomClaimsPrincipal>]

## Required Parameters

- None

Example 1:

By default, this commandlet upgrades group from the connected identity store, in case , you want to
upgrade group(s) from an OU of another identity store, specify the id of that identity store in the
_IdentityStoreId_ parameter and OU in the _SearchContainer_ parameter.

The following commandlet upgrades groups of an identity store having id 2 and from the _Jobs_
container in that identity store.

```
Upgrade-Group -IdentityStoreId "2" SearchContainer "OU=Jobs,DC=Demo1,DC=com" 
```

Example 2:

If you want to upgrade groups from a parent OU only, use the _SearchContainerScopeList_ and
_SearchContainern_ parameters. The _SearchContainerScopeList_ parameter with value 1 indicates that
the commandlet will not look into the nested OUs but the parent OU only.

The following commandlet upgrades dynasties residing in the _Jobs_ OU from their parent OU only. If
_SearchContainerScopeList_ parameter is not specified then this commandlet upgrades dynasties from
the parent OU as well as from its child OUs as well.

```
Upgrade-Group -SearchContainerScopeList "1" -SearchContainer "GIDsmart1""OU=Jobs,DC=Demo1,DC=com" GroupType "3"
```

NOTE: The group types 4 and 5 which are for middle and leaf dynasties are not supported in this
commandlet. See the [Parameters](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/managementshell/parameters.md) topic for additional information on
the supported parameters. See the [Parameters](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/managementshell/parameters.md) topic to get information
