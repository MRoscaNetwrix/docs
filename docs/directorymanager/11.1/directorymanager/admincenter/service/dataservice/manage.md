# Manage Data Service Settings

Data services in Directory Manager are displayed on the **Data Service** tab. A card for a service
displays information such as its name and status.

You can manage several settings for a service, such as:

- Change the display name of a service
- Start or stop a service
- Configure file logging for a service
- Delete a service

## View Data Service Details

Follow the steps to vew Data Service details.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click **Applications** in the left pane.

Step 2 – On the Applications page, click the **Data Service** tab. The Data Service tab page is
displayed, that lists the default Data service created while configuring Directory Manager and any
other Data service that you have created.

When multiple Directory Manager instances have been deployed, you will find multiple default Data
services on this tab page, as each instance has its own default Data service. See the
[Elasticsearch Clusters, Nodes, and Directory Manager](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/directorymanager/admincenter/service/overview.md#elasticsearch-clusters-nodes-and-directory-manager)
topic.

Step 3 – The card for a Data service displays the following information:

| Info                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
