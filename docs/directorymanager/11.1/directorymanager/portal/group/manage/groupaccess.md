# Manage Group Access

A group's security type determines how non-members can access the group and become its members.
Directory Manager provides three security types:

- Private
- Semi-Private
- Public

A security type is assigned to the group when it is created. However, you can change it later, if
required.

## Changing the security type for a group

1. In Directory Manager Portal, select **Groups**> [required group node].
2. In the groups list, click the required group and select **Set Security Type** from the above
   pane. Select any of the following:

    - Private
    - Semi-Private
    - Public

3. Click **Save**.

## Changing the security type for multiple groups

1. In Directory Manager Portal, select **Groups > [required group node]**.
2. In the groups list, select the required groups and select **Set Security Type** from the above
   pane. Select any of the following:

    - Private
    - Semi-Private
    - Public

3. Click **Save**.
