Use this page to specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and
the UPN suffix.

Step 1 – Click **Browse** next to the Container box to select a container to create the user in.

Step 2 – Enter the user's first name and last name in the respective boxes.

Step 3 – The wizard uses the provided information to populate the Display Name and User logon name

The logon name is the user ID the user will use to log into the identity store.
