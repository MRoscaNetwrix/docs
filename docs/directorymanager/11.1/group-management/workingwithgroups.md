# Working with Groups

A Directory Manager portal enables you to manage your directory groups in the identity store, so you
can do the following and more:

- Add and remove members from your groups
- Join and leave other groups
- Associate a scheduled job for membership update with Smart Groups
- Expire groups instantly or set an expiry policy to auto expire them later
