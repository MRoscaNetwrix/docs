To view a list of deleted groups, click **Groups** on the left navigation pane and select **My
Groups**. On the My Groups page, click the **My Deleted Groups** tab.

include the groups for which you are an additional owner, select the **Display additional group
ownership in My Deleted Groups** check box on the [Portal Settings](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/misc/directorymanager/portal/setting/portal.md) panel.

You can [Modify Search Directory](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/group-management/allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search deleted groups and
add [Filter All Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/group-management/allgroups.md#filter-all-groups)by clicking **My Deleted Groups Grid
Filters**. All your deleted groups matching the filters will be displayed.
