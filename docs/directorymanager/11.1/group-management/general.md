   organizational unit to create the group in and click **OK**.

   If you want to create a container, click **Create** and then add container to create the group
   in. Click **Refresh** to remove the changes.

   This field will be read-only if the administrator has predefined a container for creating new
   groups.

   name for the group.

   NOTE: The prefix box is displayed if the administrator has defined the prefixes. See Group name

   across the enterprise.

3. The **Name Preview** is displayed if the prefix list is available and displays a preview of the
   prefix combined with the group name.
4. The group name is also displayed in the **Group Name (Pre Windows 2000)** box. Modify it, if
   required.
5. Select the **Mail Enabled** check box to create the group as mail-enabled. A mail-enabled group
   is one with an email address. Members of a mail-enabled group can receive emails.
6. The **Alias** box displays an alias for creating the group's email address. You can modify the
   alias, if required.

   If Microsoft Exchange Server is the designated messaging provider for the identity store, then
   the alias length is limited to 64 characters, it does not contain spaces, and it is unique to
   the forest. For other messaging systems, the alias length must not exceed the number of
   characters supported by the respective messaging system.

   Also, the alias must not contain characters that are invalid for the configured messaging
   system.

   The **Alias** box is displayed if the **Mail Enabled** check box is selected.

7. Set the group type by selecting an option for **Group Type**.

   - **Security** - this group will be used for securing public folders, printers and other network
     resources.
   - **Distribution** - this group will only be used for email distribution.

   NOTE: If the administrator has predefined a group type, you cannot change it.

8. In the **Group Scope** list, select a scope for the group.

   - **Domain Local** - if the group is to contain only users in this domain.
   - **Global Group** - if the group is to contain users from other domains, but should only be
     visible within its own domain.
   - **Universal Group** - if the group is to contain users and groups from any domain and be
     visible in the Global Catalog.

   NOTE: (1) If the administrator has predefined a group scope, you cannot change it.  
   (2) To create a mail-enabled group (with Exchange 2013/2016/2019 as the messaging provider), you
   must select **Universal** as the group scope.

# Group properties - General tab

This tab allows you to view or modify the general information about the group.

**Display name**

The display name of the group.

**Alias**

The alias for the group.

**Manager can update membership**

Select this check box to enable the group managers (primary owner and Exchange additional owners) to
update this groupâ€™s membership directly on the directory server. Additional owners are not included
because they are Directory Manager-specific and the directory does not recognize them.

This is a provider-end permission and does not impact role-based permissions assigned at the
identity store level in Directory Manager. Nor do role-based permissions assigned at the identity
store level have any impact on this feature.

Enabling this setting auto-grants the required permissions to the manager. For Active Directory, for
example, the manager is granted the following permissions:

- Create, delete, and manage user accounts.
- Reset user password and force password change at next logon.
- Create, delete and manage groups.
- Modify the membership of a group.

NOTE: Do not update Smart Group membership manually; changes might be reversed when the Smart Group
Update job runs.

NOTE: The _manager can update membership_ feature is not available for groups in a Microsoft Entra
ID based identity store.

**Expiration Policy**

The expiry policy for this group. It specifies the duration the group remains active for. The group
would expire when the period ends.

If you select the Other option from the list, two boxes are displayed under the Expiration Policy
box. First, select an option (Days, Months, or Years) from the second list. Then enter a value for
the selected option in the first box. the group will remain active for the duration you specify
here.

The Group Life Cycle job is responsible for expiring groups.

"Never expire".

When you change the expiration policy of a group, the expiration date is updated when you save the
changes.

- **Domain Local** - Can only contain users in this domain.
- **Global Group** - Can contain users from other domains but is visible only within its own domain.
- **Universal Group** - Can contain users and groups from any domain and is visible in the Global
  Catalog.

NOTE: With Exchange 2013/2016/2019 configured as the messaging provider for the identity store, the
group scope must be set to _Universal_ for mail-enabled groups.
