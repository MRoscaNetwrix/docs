# Exchange page

(of Create User and Create Mailbox wizards)

Use this page to create the object as mail-enabled.

Step 1 – Make sure that the Mail-Enabled check box is selected to create the user as mail-enabled.

A mail-enabled user is one with an email address.

Step 2 – The Alias box displays an alias for the user.

Step 3 – The Email Type displays drop-down list of all the types of email you want to create.

Step 4 – In the Email Address box, type an email address for the user. Directory Manager uses this
email address to send email notifications to the user.

Step 5 – Click **Next**.

NOTE: To create a mail-enabled user, a messaging provider (such as Microsoft Exchange) must be
configured for the identity store.  
 If it is not configured, the Messaging page is disabled.
