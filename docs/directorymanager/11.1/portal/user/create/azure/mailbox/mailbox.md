# Create a Microsoft Entra ID Mailbox

You can create a mailbox using Directory Manager portal when a messaging provider has been
configured for the identity store.

A mailbox is a user with a mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create Mailbox wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the
administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a mailbox in an Microsoft Entra ID

Follow the steps to create a mailbox object in an Microsoft Entra ID identity store.

Step 1 – In the Directory Manager portal, click the **Create New** button and select **Mailbox**.

The Create Mailbox wizard opens to the Account page.

Step 2 – On the Account page, specify basic account info, such as the object's first name, last
name, login ID and the UPN suffix.

Step 3 – On the Password page, provide a password for the mailbox account and set other
password-specific options.

Step 4 – On the Exchange page, set the alias and Office 365 subscriptions for the mailbox.

your changes will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the
