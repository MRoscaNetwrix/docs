# Public Groups

This view lists only the public groups created using Directory Manager in the connected identity
store. It does not list expired or deleted public groups. To view the expired or deleted groups,
select the [Expired Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/group/allgroups/allexpiredgroups.md) or [Deleted Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/group/recyclebin/overview.md)
respectively.

You can [Modify Search Directory](allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search private groups and
add [Filter All Groups](allgroups.md#filter-all-groups) by clicking **Public Group Grid Filters**.
All the public groups matching the filters will be displayed.
