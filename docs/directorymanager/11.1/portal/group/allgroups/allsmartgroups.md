# Smart Groups

This view lists only the Smart Groups created using Directory Manager in the connected identity
store. It does not list expired or deleted Smart Groups. To view the expired or deleted groups,
select the [Expired Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/group/allgroups/allexpiredgroups.md) or [Deleted Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/portal/group/recyclebin/overview.md)
respectively.

You can [Modify Search Directory](allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search smart groups and
add [Filter All Groups](allgroups.md#filter-all-groups)by clicking **Smart Group Grid Filter**. All
the smart groups matching the filters will be displayed.
