| Membership   | Indicates whether the user is a temporary or permanent member of the group. - Perpetual – To make the object a permanent member of the group. - Temporary Member – To make the object a temporary member of the group for the period you specify in the Beginning and Ending boxes. At the end of the period, the object is removed from the group membership. - Addition Pending – Indicates that the object will be a temporary member of the group for a period in the future. Use the Beginning and Ending boxes to set a period. Before the beginning date, the object’s membership type is displayed as ‘Addition Pending’. On the beginning date, the membership type changes to ‘Temporary Member’. Example. You add Smith as a temporary member to Group A on May 15 for future dates, May 20-30. Smith will be displayed in Group A’s membership with ‘Addition Pending’ as its membership type from May 15 to 19. However, Smith would not be added to group membership in the provider. On May 20, Smith will become a temporary member of Group A and its membership type will change to ‘Temporary Member’ from May 20 to 30. Smith will also be added to group membership in the provider. After May 30, Smith will be removed from Group A as a member in Directory Manager and in the provider. - Removal Pending - Indicates that the object will be temporarily removed from group membership for a period in the future. Use the Beginning and Ending boxes to set a period. Before the beginning date, the object’s membership type is displayed as ‘Removal Pending’. On the beginning date, the membership type will change to ‘Temporary Removed’. Example. You remove Smith from Group A on May 15 for future dates, May 20-30. Smith will be displayed in Group A’s membership with ‘Removal Pending’ as membership type from May 15 to 19. On May 20, Smith’s membership type in Directory Manager will change to ‘Temporary Removed’; lasting till May 30. However, Smith will be removed from Group A’s membership in the provider. After May 30, Smith will be added back to Group A as a permanent member in Directory Manager and in the provider. - Temporary Removed – Indicates that the object is temporarily removed from group membership for the period specified in the Beginning and Ending boxes. At the end of the period, the object is added back to the group membership as a permanent member. When the user is a perpetual member, the **Membership** column is blank. You cannot change the membership type of the user for any group on the **Member Of** tab. Rather, go to the properties of the specific group and change the user's membership type on the [Group properties - Members tab](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/group-management/managing-members.md). |
