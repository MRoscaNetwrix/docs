## 2FA via Google Authenticator Configuration

The first time logging in to SecureONE, if your organization has not already tied the SecureONE
authorization process into an existing MFA solution, enter the domain credentials in the following
manner and select the 'Sign In' button:

After "Sign In" is selected, the following prompt will appear:

Scan this barcode into the Google Authenticator application on your mobile device.  This will act
as  your MFA token until SecureONE is tied into another MFA solution such as DUO, Okta, Ping, etc. 
Once another MFA solution has been configured, this solution will replace the Google Authenticator
solution above entirely.
