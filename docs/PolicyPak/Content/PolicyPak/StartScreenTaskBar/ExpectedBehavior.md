# Expected Behavior When Policies No Longer Apply

When Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager policies apply, users cannot work around your settings. However, when the GPO (or other policy delivery method) applying that policy no longer applies, reverts, or is deleted, the groups will remain with icons intact, as seen in Figure 49.

Figure 49. After a policy no longer applies, users are free to manage their Start Menu groups.

At this point, users are free to add or remove icons from the groups or delete the group. If the policies ever come back into effect, they will reapply and lock down the groups again.
