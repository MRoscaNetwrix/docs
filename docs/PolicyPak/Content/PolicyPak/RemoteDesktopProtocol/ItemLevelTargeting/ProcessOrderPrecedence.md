# Understanding Processing Order and Precedence

Within a particular GPO (Computer or User side), the processing order is counted in numerical order. So, lower-numbered collections attempt to process first, and higher-numbered collections attempt to process last. Then, within any collection, each policy is processed in numerical order from lowest to highest.
