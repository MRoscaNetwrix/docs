# Using Endpoint Policy Manager to Enable or Disable Add-Ons

Video: To see a video of Endpoint Policy Manager enabling or disabling Firefox's add-ons, go to 

Firefox has four categories of add-ons, as shown in Figure 16.

* Recommendations
* Extensions
* Themes
* Plugins

Figure 16. The Add-ons Manager.

Endpoint Policy Manager can enable or disable add-ons in these categories. In the next section we'll see how to force installation (or force removal) of add-ons. Endpoint Policy Manager has two methods to manage Firefox add-ons:

* Option 1: By knowing the GUID or "friendly name" of the extension. Knowing this, you can set the state to "disable" or "enable," as seen below in Figure
* Option 2: Using wildcards to disable specific add-on types.

You can see the "Add-Ons" tab, and the "Enable or Disable" section within the Firefox AppSet as seen in Figure 17.
