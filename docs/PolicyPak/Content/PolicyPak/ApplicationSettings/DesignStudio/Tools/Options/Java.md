# Java Tab

Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio currently has experimental support for capturing Java-based applications. In order to capture Java-based applications, you will need to do the following:

**Step 1 –** Install the Java Access Bridge (free software from Java/Oracle).

**Step 2 –** Fully turn off user account control (during the user interface [UI] capture).

Without the Java Access Bridge installed, the Java tab will look like what's shown in Figure 169.
