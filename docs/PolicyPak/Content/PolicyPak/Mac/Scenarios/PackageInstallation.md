# Package Installation Policy

**NOTE:** See the [Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager for Macs Application Package Support](../../Video/LeastPrivilege/Mac/ApplicationPackage "Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager for Macs Application Package Support") video for an overview of this section.

When a standard user attempts to install a .PKG file they are not allowed to do so. In this example, Skype for Business prompts the user for admin credentials before installing.
