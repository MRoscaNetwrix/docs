Logging occurs on the endpoint. Use the Event Log first to look for events.

In addition, you can use Endpoint Policy Manager's text based logs.

You will need admin access to see `c:\ProgramData\PolicyPak\PolicyPak` Device Manager logs.

Each log occurs when different policy triggering events occur. Special log is ppComputer\_Operational.log which explains what's happening in real-time on the machine.
