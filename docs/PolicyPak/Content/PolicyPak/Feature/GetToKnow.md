# Getting to Know Feature Manager for Windows

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Feature Manager for Windows is contained within the Endpoint Policy Manager node. Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows MMC snap-in allows you to create new Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager collections or policies.

**NOTE:** You will only see the Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows node when the latest Admin Console MSI is installed on the management station.

The functions of collections and policies are as follows:

* Policies are the rules that perform the work.
* Collections are groupings of policies.

Both collections and policies may have Item-Level Targeting, which is explained later, but you can target policies based upon the criteria that you specify.
