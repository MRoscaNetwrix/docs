You can delete a policy by right-clicking it and selecting **Delete Policy**.

**NOTE:** This will not revert the current state on the machine. That is, a policy set to install a feature, upon deletion, will not uninstall a feature. And a policy set to uninstall a feature, when deleted, will not reinstall a feature.
