# Advanced Manipulations of Policies and Collections

In this section we cover a few advanced topics. First, we explore some areas where you can manipulate policies without the wizard. For instance, we'll start out by showing you how you can delete policies, edit policies, and edit collections without the wizard. Then, we will also explore the idea of **Mixed Rule** along with how to create collections within the wizard.
