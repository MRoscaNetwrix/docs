# Getting to Know Scripts & Triggers Manager

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Scripts & Triggers Manager is contained within the PolicyPak node, as demonstrated in Figure 4. Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager MMC snap-in enables you to create a new Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager policy or collection.

**NOTE:** You will only see the Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts & Triggers Manager node when the latest Admin Console MSI is installed on the management station.
