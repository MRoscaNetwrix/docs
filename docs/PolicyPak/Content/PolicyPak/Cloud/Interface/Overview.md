# Web Interface and Controls

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud has several roles:

* Acts as a licensing broker, enabling some computers to be licensed through the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI and connection to the Cloud service.
* Stores XML directives which can be created with the in-cloud editors or exported from the on-prem MMC console.
* Enables a relationship between licensed computers and groups, which allows them to get XML directives.
* Works as a delivery mechanism for created XML directives.

The Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud web interface contains the following sections:
