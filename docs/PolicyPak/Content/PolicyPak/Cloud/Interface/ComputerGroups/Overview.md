# Computer Groups

You are likely to spend most of your time working onthe **Computer Groups** tab. In this tab covers the following features

* Groups. There are two types of groups:

  * Built-in groups (created by the system)
  * Company groups (created by you)
* Create policies using the XML data files tab or the in-cloud editors
* Link XML data files to the computer group of your choice

**NOTE:** The actions that appear on the right when you click on a group are context sensitive.

This is an example of items and actions that are available when you click a policy.

In the next sections, we cover the following:

* Creating policies with the in-cloud editors
* Working with groups

  * Built-in groups
  * Company groups
  * Policy forecast/modeling report
  * Policy link order
  * Block inheritance and enforce
  * Search box

## Creating Policies with In-Cloud Editors

After you click on a group, you can create a policy to link to the group using the in-cloud editor.

**NOTE:**  If you want to create a policy but not link it yet, then use the XML Data Files tab. By creating the policy there, it will not be linked anywhere until you come back to the **Computer Groups** tab and perform the link.

In the example below, we clicked on the **All** group, then selected **Create and link a new Policy....** When you do this, the **Create policy** dialog appears, and you can select the in-cloud editor of your choice.

For details and guidance on using the in-cloud editors, refer back to the previous section on creating policies.

**NOTE:** Not all Endpoint Policy Manager nor all Group Policy Preferences types have in-cloud editors. As such, you need to use your on-prem test lab to create and test the policy first. For more information, refer to the **Creating a Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud On-Prem Test Lab** and **Upload XML Data File** sections.

Once you have your exported policy XML data file, you can select the group, then select Upload and link a new XML here and then, paste the XML data.
