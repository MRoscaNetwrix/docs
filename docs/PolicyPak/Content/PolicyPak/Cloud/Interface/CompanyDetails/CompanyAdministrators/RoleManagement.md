The following roles are available:

* Authentication Options Admin: An admin with this role can specify which admins can have which 2FA options. Additionally, they may also set customer-level portal policies as described in the [Edit Customer-Level Portal Policies](../EditCustomerLevelPortalPolicies "Edit Customer-Level Portal Policies") section. Specifically, they can force email-based or application-based 2FA for all admins. They can also set the 2FA one-time password lifetime, as well as the automatic log off on idle time.
* Notification & Logging Options Admin: An admin with this role can use the **Notifications Editor** For more information, see the [Edit Notification Configuration](../EditNotificationConfiguration "Edit Notification Configuration") section).
* Customer Admin Manager: An admin with this role can approve newly created admins when other admins initiate the request.
