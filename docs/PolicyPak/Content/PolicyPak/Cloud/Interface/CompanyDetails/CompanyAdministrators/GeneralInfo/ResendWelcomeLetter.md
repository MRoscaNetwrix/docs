# Resend Welcome Letter

The **Resend Welcome Letter** action is typically performed when one admin cannot log on, and needs another admin to reset his password. In this case, the helping admin would select Resend Welcome Letter, which would send a new welcome letter to the other admin, thus enabling access again.
