# Edit Customer-Level Portal Policies

Customer-level portal policies are only available for admins with the **Authentication Options Admin** role.

Someone with this role may set the following values:

* Require 2Fa for PPC Login: This will always be enabled and cannot be disabled, even by someone with the **Authentication Options Admin** role. However, you can set email-based or application-based authentication to be used for all admins in Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.
* Require automatic logoff on idle: The portal will automatically log off all admins at 15 minutes (with a several minute countdown timer).
* Set email-based 2Fa OTP lifetime: If email 2FA is used, the one-time password has a lifetime of 10 minutes. This can be changed here.
