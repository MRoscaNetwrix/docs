# Will I need a license server to manage my Endpoint Policy Manager licenses?

There are absolutely no servers involved in the licensing process for Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak), so you will not need a license server. Licenses are contained within a Group Policy Object and are typically linked to the domain, but can be linked to a specific OU.
