# How can I verify, test and/or reset my Domain Join (aka SecureChannel) from the endpoint to domain controller?

You can use `PPUPDATE` to show the current domain joined status.

Here is an example of `PPUPDATE` command showing a correctly joined on-prem Active Directory joined machine:

When not domain joined:

When the secure channel has been broken and needs to be re-established:

See this Microsoft article on [Resetting computer accounts in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/resetting-computer-accounts-in-windows-762e3208-0e05-1696-75fa-333d90717d1e "Resetting computer accounts in Windows") for additional information.

To attempt to reset the secure channel on a specific PC, make sure you have network connectivity to a Domain Controller.

**Step 1 â€“** Open PowerShell As Administrator:

```
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Verbose
```
If False then run:

```
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Repair -Server PDCEmulatorName -Verbose
```
If repaired you will see message, if it fails then try adding a credential:

```
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Repair -Server PDCEmulatorName -Credential Domain\UserName -Verbose
```
