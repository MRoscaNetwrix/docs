# XML Data Files from Endpoint Policy Feature Manager

Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager settings can be exported as an XML file. You can export a single policy, a collection, or the whole node. Feature Manager only supports computer rules. In this example, we have created an install rule and an uninstall rule, and we are exporting the entire collection by right-clicking `Computer Configuration | PolicyPak | Feature Manager` for Windows 10 and Windows Server and picking the collection we wish to export.

Alternatively, we could select a designated setting to export as well. Right-click `Computer Configuration | PolicyPak | Security Manager`, and select the setting that is available in the menu, as shown in Figure 29.
