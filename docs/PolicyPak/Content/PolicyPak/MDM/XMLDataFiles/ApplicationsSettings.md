# XML Data Files from Endpoint Policy Manager Applications Settings Manager

If you have a Group Policy Object (GPO) with an existing Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager directive within the GPO, you can use it to create XML data files.

**NOTE:** If you don't already have a Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager directive ready, you can use our Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter utility to make one (which will be discussed next).

**Step 1 â€“** To utilize an existing GPO with a Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager directive, right-click the directive containing your existing settings and select "Export settings to XMLData File," as shown in Figure 11. Then save the XML file for the next step.
