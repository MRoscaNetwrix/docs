# Besides the installation of Design Studio, are there any additional components I need on my computer in order to create my own AppSets?

You will need to install the free Visual C++ 2008 SP1, 2010 or 2012, 2015 or 2017 Express Edition as well as any applications you wish to manage with Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Design Studio. This is a free download from Microsoft.
