# Exporting Collections

Appendix A: [Using Endpoint Policy Manager with MDM and UEM Tools](../MDM/UEMTools "Using Endpoint Policy Manager with MDM and UEM Tools") explains how to use the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Exporter to wrap up any Endpoint Policy Manager directives and deliver them using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (SCCM and Intune), KACE, your own MDM service, or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud.

To export a policy for later use using Endpoint Policy Manager Exporter or Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud, right-click the collection or the policy and select **Export to XML**. This will enable you to save an XML file, which you can use later.

Remember that Endpoint Policy Manager RDP policies can be created and exported on the User or Computer side. For instance, below you can see an item being exported from the Computer side.
