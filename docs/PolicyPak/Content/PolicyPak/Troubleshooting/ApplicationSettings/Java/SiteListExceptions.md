# Java: Java Site List Exceptions just stopped working. What can I do to fix this?

Sometimes Java will create an errant file which prevents Java Site Exceptions list from working as expected.

The file is zero bytes and found in

```
appdatalocallowsunjavadeploymentsecurity
```
For manual testing on one machine, delete that file, then run GPupdate to refresh.

See if Java Site exceptions starts to work.
