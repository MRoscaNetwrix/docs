# Are there any required permission settings for a Endpoint Policy ManagerAdministrator to store Endpoint Policy Manager Suite DLL Extensions to the central store?

The central store is located within the SYSVOL folder of any domain controller. A user must be a Domain Administrator in order to copy PolicyPakPaks to the SYSVOL folder.
