# What if I am having trouble getting the Licensing GPO installed?

First, try running the LT as Domain Administrator. 99.9% of the problems with the licensing GPO is that the person creating the licensing GPO doesn't have rights to do so. So, try that first.

If that fails, this  demonstrates how you can definitely get it to work.
