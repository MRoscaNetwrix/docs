# Internet Explorer: Why Internet Explorer is not launching after I apply "Perform ACL Lockdown"?

If you select ACL Lockdown from the IE option you may experience that the iexplorer.exe process closes itself, thus failing IE with successful launch.

That's because, currently we have limitation with that feature support in IE. So uncheck the option "Perform ACL Lockdown" by right-clicking on the PolicyPak elements:
