# Endpoint Policy Manager Start Screen & Taskbar Manager crashes, hangs or is slow when running Group Policy update. Why?

The WAP Push Message Routing Service must be enabled on the machine as Manual (Trigger Start) or Running for Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Start Screen & Taskbar Manager to function.  
Do not disable this dmwappushservice service.
