# Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud shows "The license certificate has expired". Why is this?

If you see this when running ppcloud command, this means that this machine WAS getting a license, but you have now over-subscribed your account.

This computer then transitions to the WAITING LIST and can pick up a new license if one becomes available.

To learn more about the WAITING LIST, [Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Client: Why are computers appearing in WAITING LIST and how can I fix it?](WaitingList).
