# I want all the files in a folder to be ALLOWED when SecureRun is used. What is the correct syntax?

If you want to allow all files in a folder to be permitted when SecureRun is used, do not use this syntax.

Instead, if you want to allow all .exe files in the application folder, then you should be using either

%localappdata%\Slack (no wildcard/asterisk) + Folder typelike what's seen hereâ€¦

Or

%localappdata%\Slack\\* + File type
