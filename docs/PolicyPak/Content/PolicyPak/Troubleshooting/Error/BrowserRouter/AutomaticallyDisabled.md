You can use this chart to see the Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router Extension you should allow to install: [What is the Chrome Extension ID for all the published versions of Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router Client Side Extension?](../../BrowserRouter/ClientSideExtension/ChromeExtensionID)
