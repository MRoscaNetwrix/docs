# Event Logs

The Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR client (admin console) logs warnings and errors to the Windows Event Viewer in the application log. Because a lot of data could be in the log, use the filters shown in Figure 76 to make a custom view showing only Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR events in the application log.

If asked by Endpoint Policy Manager Support, be prepared to export these events for analysis.
