# What does "Unsupported item" mean in PPGPCR reports and tests?

PPGPCR can report upon many items. But PPGPCR cannot report on every data type contained within a GPO.

Therefore if a test / GPO contains unsupported data that cannot be TESTED against, we provide an alert similar to what's seen here:

The current list of what is supported and not supported is listed in the PPGPCR manual in a table in the first 15 pages.
