# Using Block Policies

You can block specific websites by making a rule and selecting the **Block** website type. You can choose to provide **Block Text**, which will appear in a pop-up for the user, explaining why they cannot visit the website.

**NOTE:** For an overview of using Block policies, see the following video: [Block web sites from opening in all browsers.](../../Video/BrowserRouter/BlockWebsites "Block web sites from opening in all browsers.")

When you include text in the **Block Text** field, the endpoint will react in all browsers with a pop-up like this one.

**NOTE:** If you leave the **Block Text** field empty, default text is automatically provided.
