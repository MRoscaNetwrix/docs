# What is PPBREdgePackage and When is it used?

PPBREdgePackage is automatically installed when
Edge Legacy is present and a Browser Router policy is linked to the endpoint. It is designed to enforce Browser
Router policies within the Edge Legacy browser.

This
application can be found listed under Apps & Features

PPBREdgePackage is the legacy equivalent of the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Browser Router
Chromium Extension and is not needed for Edge Chromium or any other browser.

To verify
Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router Chromium Extension is installed on
Edge Chromium, look for the Endpoint Policy Manager icon, which can usually be seen in the top-right corner with the other
extensions.
