# Endpoint Policy Manager Application Setting Manager (Understanding Trusted AppSets)

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager now ships signed AppSets from Netwrix. This means that all the DLLs (AppSets) we ship are digitally signed and unaltered and you know they came from us. Watch this video to understand how to take advantage of this feature.
