# Mass copy folders and files (with filters and recursion)

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Remote Work Delivery Manager enables you to copy files from a source and keep them up to date. It's a like a swiss army knife... for copying files. Copy one folder, multiple folders, and/or recursively or not. Keep target folders up to date with one, single policy... instead of deploying files each and every time.
