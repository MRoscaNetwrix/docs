# If I want to totally stop using Endpoint Policy ManagerCloud on an endpoint, how would I remove the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client pieces remotely?

If you use Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud UI and use the **Delete permanently** command, the next time the Cloud Client syncs to the Cloud Service all cloud pieces (Cloud agent and Cloud CSE) are physically removed from the endpoint automatically.
