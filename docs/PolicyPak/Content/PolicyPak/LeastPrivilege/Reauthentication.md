# Understanding Re-authentication & Justification Text

There might be times you want users to re-authenticate and/or provide justification text about their actions. Justification text is logged to the local event log for later review.

Here, on the left youâ€™ll see a Self Elevate rule, and on the right a standard Elevation rule.

You can see both rule types have the options for **Require Justification Text** and **Force user to reauthenticate**.

**NOTE:** See the [Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager: Self Elevate Mode](../Video/LeastPrivilege/BestPractices/SelfElevateMode "Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager: Self Elevate Mode") video for a demonstration of Justification text for Self Elevate.

**NOTE:** See the [Endpoint Privilege: Re-Authenticate with Self Elevate](../Video/LeastPrivilege/SelfElevateMode/Reauthenticate "Endpoint Privilege: Re-Authenticate with Self Elevate") video for a demonstration of re-authentication for Self Elevate.

You can force a user to **Require Justification Text** for normal elevation actions, as well as Self Elevate policies.

The following cases highlight how this might work.

## Case 1

**Show popup message** is selected, but neither sub-option are checked.
