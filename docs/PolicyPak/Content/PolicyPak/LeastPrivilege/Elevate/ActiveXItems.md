# Elevating ActiveX Items

**NOTE:** For an overview of Elevating ActiveX Items see the [Overcome UAC prompts for Active X controls](../../Video/LeastPrivilege/UACPromptsActiveX "Overcome UAC prompts for Active X controls") video.

ActiveX items are still important to many organizations who rely upon them. Even though Internet Explorer isnâ€™t available anymore, ActiveX controls still work in IE Mode for Windows 10 and 11 with Edge.

Trying to install ActiveX controls as a Standard User is not allowed.

You can use ActiveX rules and specify the CAB file you want to permit.

Then, clicking on **Validate & Add** will attempt to determine if the CAB is signed and add that requirement to the rule.
