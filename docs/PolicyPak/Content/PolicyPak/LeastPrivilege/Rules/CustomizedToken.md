# Run with Customized Token

On rare occasions you might need to change some of the attributes of a process’ token instead of a blanket Elevate. You may do this via the **Run with customized token** function when creating a rule.

Here you can change a variety of functions about the token including its permissions, privileges and security, as well as Integrity level.

The common use cases for needing to manage a customized token are:

* Handling service accounts’ permissions.For more in formation, see the [Reduce or specify Service Account Rights](../../Video/LeastPrivilege/BestPractices/ServiceAccountRights "Reduce or specify Service Account Rights") video demonstration.
* Drag-and-drop issues between applications. For ore information, see the [I elevated an application, but drag and drop between the elevated and other non-elevated applications isn't working anymore. What can I try?](../Elevate/DragDrop "I elevated an application, but drag and drop between the elevated and other non-elevated applications isn't working anymore. What can I try?") topic.
