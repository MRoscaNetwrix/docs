# Creating Policy from Audit Event

Once you have generated events and store them locally or forward them to a service, you can automatically create rules from events.

If you are using Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud you can store events from endpoints and then automatically transition those events to rules. See the [Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud + PPLPM + Events: Collect Events in the Cloud](../../../Video/LeastPrivilege/CloudEvents "Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud + PPLPM + Events: Collect Events in the Cloud") video for additional information.

If you have stored Windows events, you can use the details from those events to make rules using the MMC snap-in.

**NOTE:** See the [Auto-Create Policy from Global Audit event](../../../Video/LeastPrivilege/GlobalAuditEvent "Auto-Create Policy from Global Audit event")video for a demonstration of this.
