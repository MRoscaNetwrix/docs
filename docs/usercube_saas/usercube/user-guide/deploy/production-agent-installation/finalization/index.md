# Finalize the Installation

This guide shows how finalize the installation of the agent.

## Overview

This page describes the last few steps that the production agent needs for Identity Manager to run
correctly.

## Finalize the Installation

Finalize the installation of the agent by proceeding as follows:

1. Install
   [Windows' hosting bundle for ASP.Net Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

    If the bundle was installed before
    [ Configure the Pool and Site ](../iis-configuration/index.md), then IIS might not display the
    AspNetCore module and Identity Manager will not run. In this case, relaunch the bundle's
    installation executable to perform a repair.

2. When using a proxy, adjust the configuration accordingly. See the
   [ Reverse Proxy ](../../../../installation-guide/reverse-proxy/index.md)topic for additional
   information.

## Next Steps

To continue, follow the instructions to verify the agent's installation. See the
[ Install the Production Agent ](../index.md) topic for additional information.
