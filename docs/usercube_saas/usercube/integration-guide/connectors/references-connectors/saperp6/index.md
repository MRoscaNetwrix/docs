![Package: ERP/SAP ERP 6.0](/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/saperp6/packages_saperp6_v603.webp)

## Overview

The SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (SAP ERP) software incorporates the core business processes of an organization, such as finance, production, supply chain services, procurements, human resources (HR), etc. The SAP ERP connector exports and fulfills data from/to an SAP ERP 6.0 system.

## Prerequisites

Implementing this connector requires:

- Reading first the appsettings documentation; See the [appsettings.agent](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings-agent/index.md) topic for additional information.
- An ASE or HANA database with a service account, as a database administrator
- A service account, as a SAP user with at least the roles for user management
- The prerequisites for reading should be set up
- The prerequisites for writing should be set up

ASE or HANA database with a service account, as a database administrator

To connect to the SAP database using SSH, use the following commands:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

```
su sybaba  
isql -S <database (ABA is the default value)> -U<administrator's login> -P<administrator's password> -X
```

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

```
isql -S ABA -Usapsso -PV1H#M$4JIgU$qd -X
```

Service account, as a SAP user with at least the roles for user management

Create a login for Identity Manager's service account with at least reading access on user management tables by using a command from the table below:

| Table | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| USR02 | Users table |
| AGR_USERS | Links between Users and Roles |
| AGR_TEXTS | Roles labels according to the language |
| USER_ADDR |  |
| AGR_1016  AGR_PROF | Links between Profiles and Roles |
| USR10 | Profiles tables |
| USR11 | Profiles labels |
| AGR_DEFINE | Roles table |
| AGR_AGRS | Composition links |
| USGRP | Groups table |
| USGRPT | Groups labels |
| UST04 | Links between Users and Profiles |
| UST10C | Links between Profiles and Sub-profiles |
| AGR_TCODES | Links between Roles and Transactions |
| T002 | Languages codes |

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

execute sp_addlogin ```<login>```, ```<password>```, ```<database (ABA is the default value)>```go
use ABA
go
execute sp_adduser ```<login>```go
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.USR02 to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.AGR_USERS to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.USER_ADDR to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.AGR_1016 to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.USR10 to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.USR11 to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.AGR_AGRS to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.USGRP to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.UST04 to usercube
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.AGR_TCODES to user
grant select on ABA.SAPSR3.T002 to usercube
Go

Set up the prerequisites for reading

To set up the prerequisites for reading follow the steps below.

__Step 1 –__ Copy the DLL ```Sap.Data.Hana.Core.v2.1.dll``` into the Runtime of Identity Manager.

![connectorreadprerequisites1](/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/saperp6/connectorreadprerequisites1.webp)

__Step 2 –__ Unzip the “hdbclient.zip” archive to C: drive and add the path to the Path environment variables.

![connectorreadprerequisites2](/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/saperp6/connectorreadprerequisites2.webp)

__Step 3 –__ Create environment variables: ```HDBADOTNET=C:\hdbclient\ado.net``` and ```HDBADOTNETCORE=C:\hdbclient\dotnetcore```.

Set up the prerequisites for writing

__NOTE:__ Make sure the Read prerequisites are configured first.

__Step 1 –__ Copy the provided DLL ```sapnwrfc.dl``` into the Runtime of Identity Manager.

__Step 2 –__ Unzip the ```dotnet86.zip``` archive to ```C:\dotnetx86```.

__Step 3 –__ Copy the DLLs icudt50.dll, ```icuin50.dll``` and icuuc50.dll into the Runtime of Identity Manager.

__Step 4 –__ Disable DLLs search by adding the environment variable ```NLSUI_7BIT_FALLBACK=YES```.

![connectorwriteprerequisites2](/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/saperp6/connectorwriteprerequisites2.webp)

__Step 5 –__ Add new environment variable ```USERCUBE_DOTNET32``` containing the path to dotnetx86 (e.g.: ```C: \donetx86\dotnet.exe```).

## Export

This connector extracts users, roles, profiles, profile memberships, role memberships and groups from an SAP ERP instance, and writes the output to CSV files.

### Configuration

This process is configured through a connection in the UI and/or the XML configuration, and in the __appsettings.agent.json__ > __Connections__ section. See the [
Connection
](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connection/index.md) topic for additional information.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

```
appsettings.agent.json  
{  
  ...  
  "Connections": {  
    ...  
    "<ConnectionIdentifier>": {  
      ...  
    }  
  }  
}
```

_Remember,_ the identifier of the connection and thus the name of the subsection must:
  
- Be unique  
- Not begin with a digit.
  
- Not contain `<`, `>`, `:`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`, `*`, and `_`.

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

```
appsettings.agent.json  
{  
    ...  
    "Connections": {  
        ...  
        "SAPExportFulfillment": {  
            "Server": "serverUrl",  
            "AseLogin": "login",  
            "AsePassword": "password",  
            "Instance": "sapInstance",  
            "Port": "4242",  
            "Client": "123",  
            "Language": "fr"  
        }  
    }  
}  

```

#### Setting attributes

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IsHana   default value: false | Boolean | True to connect to an S/4 HANA instance instead of an ERP 6.0. |
| Server   required | String | URL of the SAP ERP server. |
| BapiLogin   required | String | Login to connect to the specified server. |
| BapiPassword   required | String | Password to connect to the specified server. |

### Password reset

See the [appsettings.agent](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings-agent/index.md) topic for additional information on how to configure password reset settings.

When setting a password for an SAP ERP user, the password attribute is defined by the password specified in the corresponding RessourceTypeMapping. See the [Sap Resource Type Mapping](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/resourcetypemappings/sapresourcetypemapping/index.md) topic for additional information.

### Credential protection

Data protection can be ensured through:

- RSA encryption, configured in the ```appsettings.encrypted.agent.json``` file
- An Azure Key Vault safe

| Attribute | Naming Convention for the Key in Azure Key Vault |
| --- | --- |
| Server | Connections--```<identifier>```--Server |
| AseLogin | Connections--```<identifier>```--AseLogin |
| AsePassword | Connections--```<identifier>```--AsePassword |
| Instance | Connections--```<identifier>```--Instance |
| Port | Connections--```<identifier>```--Port |
| Client | Connections--```<identifier>```--Client |
| Language | Connections--```<identifier>```--Language |
| BapiLogin | Connections--```<identifier>```--BapiLogin |
| BapiPassword | Connections--```<identifier>```--BapiPassword |
| SystemNumber | Connections--```<identifier>```--SystemNumber |

- A CyberArk Vault able to store Active Directory's Login, Password, and Server.

See the [
RSA Encryption
](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/rsa-encryption/index.md), [Azure Key Vault](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/azure-key-vault/index.md), and [CyberArk's AAM Credential Providers
](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/cyberark-application-access-manager-credential-providers/index.md)topics for additional information.

Protected attributes are stored inside a safe in CyberArk, into an account whose identifier can be retrieved by Identity Manager from ```appsettings.cyberark.agent.json```.

For example:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the script in the command line.

```
appsettings.cyberark.agent.json  
{  
  ...  
  "Connections": {  
    ...  
    "SAPExportFulfillment": {  
        "Login": "SAPExportFulfillment_CyberArkKey",  
        "Password": "SAPExportFulfillment_CyberArkKey",  
        "Server": "SAPExportFulfillment_CyberArkKey"  
    }  
  }  
}
```
