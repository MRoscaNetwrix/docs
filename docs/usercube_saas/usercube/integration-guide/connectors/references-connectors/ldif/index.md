# LDIF

This connector exports entries from an [LDIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP_Data_Interchange_Format) file.

## Overview

The LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) is a standard plain text data interchange format for representing LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory content and update requests. LDIF conveys directory content as a set of records, one record for each object (or entry). It also represents update requests, such as Add, Modify, Delete, and Rename, as a set of records, one record for each update request.

## Prerequisites

Implementing this connector requires no particular prerequisites.

## Export

This connector generates a CSV file from an input LDIF file containing entries to be exported.

### Configuration

This process is configured through a [
Connection
](/docs/product_docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connection/index.md)in the UI and/or the XML configuration, and in the ```appsettings.agent.json > Connections``` section:

```
appsettings.agent.json
{
  ...
  "Connections": {
    ...
    "<ConnectionIdentifier>": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

The identifier of the connection and thus the name of the subsection must:
  
- be unique.
  
- not begin with a digit.
  
- not contain ```<```, ```>```, ```:```, ```"```, ```/```, ```\```, ```|```, ```?```, ```*``` and ```_```.

> For example:
>
> ```
> appsettings.agent.json
> {
>   ...
>   "Connections": {
>     ...
>     "LdifExport": {
>         "LDIFFile": "C:/UsercubeContoso/Contoso/contoso.ldif",
>         "FilterAttribute": "objectClass",
>         "FilterValues": "user organizationalUnit",
>         "Attributes": [ "dn", "objectClass", "cn", "SAMAccountName", "Name", "userprincipalname" ],
>         "LdifEncoding": "UTF-8",
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

#### Setting attributes

| Name | Details |
| --- | --- |
| LDIFFile   required | __Type__    String   __Description__ Path of the LDIF input file. |
| FilterAttribute   required | __Type__    String   __Description__ Property from the connector's configuration whose value is to be compared with the values from ```FilterValues```, in order to filter the entries to export. |
| FilterValues   required | __Type__    String   __Description__ List of values to be compared with the value of ```FilterAttribute```, in order to filter the entries to export. Identity ManagerÂ will export only the entries matching the filter.   __Note:__ multiple values must be separated by white spaces. |
| Attributes   required | __Type__    String List   __Description__ List of properties from the connector's configuration to be exported. |
| LdifEncoding   default value: UTF-8 | Encoding of the file. [See the list of available encodings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding#See-the-list-of-available-encodings). |

### Output details

This connector is meant to generate to the [Application Settings](/docs/product_docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings/index.md)Export Output folder a CSV file named ```LdifExport.csv```, with the following columns:

```
LdifExport.csv
Command,dn,objectClass,cn,SAMAccountName,Name,userprincipalname
Insert,value1,value2,...,valueN
```

## Fulfill

There are no fulfill capabilities for this connector.

## Authentication

### Credential protection

This connector has no credential attributes, and therefore does not use [](/docs/product_docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/rsa-encryption/index.md)[
Connection
](/docs/product_docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connection/index.md), nor a [
Connection
](/docs/product_docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connection/index.md)Vault.

Still, data protection can be ensured through an [
Connection
](/docs/product_docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connection/index.md) safe.
