# Prepare Synchronization Task

## View Behavior Details

The task reads files from the source directory, usually the temp folder >Export Output folder. See the [Application Settings](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings/index.md)topic for additional information.

### Cleanse data

The following actions are performed on the _CSV source files_:

1. Remove columns that are not used in [
   Entity Type Mapping
   ](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entitytypemapping/index.md) or [
   Entity Association Mapping
   ](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entityassociationmapping/index.md).
2. Remove entries that have a null primary key.
3. Remove duplicates.
4. Sort entries according to the primary key.

The result of the _Prepare-Synchronization_ is stored in the [Application Settings](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/server-configuration/general-purpose/index.md)directory as three files:

- For every entity type of the relevant _Connector_ involved in an [
  Entity Type Mapping
  ](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entitytypemapping/index.md)> or an [
  Entity Association Mapping
  ](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entityassociationmapping/index.md), a ```.sorted.csv``` file is generated, containing the final, cleansed and sorted result.
- Duplicates are kept in a separate ```.duplicates.csv``` file.
- Null primary key entries are kept in a separate ```.nullpk.csv``` file.

All files produced by the task are in the work folder > Collect directory.

### Compute changes

In _incremental_ mode, changes might need to be computed by the _Agent_:

- If the Export step has provided computed changes, no further process is required. The changes will be sent as-is to the server.
- If the Export step has provided a full extract of the managed systems, the _Prepare-Synchronization_ step computes changes. This computation is based on the result of the last data cleansing, generated by the previous _Prepare-Synchronization_, and stored in the ```previous``` folder in the [Application Settings](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/server-configuration/general-purpose/index.md)directory.

For _incremental_ mode, it is recommended, whenever possible, to use managed systems to compute changes. Dedicated workstations and knowledge of the inner data organization allow managed systems to compute changes with performance that Identity Manager can't match. Using managed systems for these operations avoids generating heavy files and alleviates Identity Manager's processing load.

The result is a set of clean lists of changes stored as a ```.sorted.delta``` file containing a _command_ column. The _command_ column can take the following values:

- _insert_
- _update_
- _delete_
- _merge_

These values are instructions for the _Synchronization_ step to apply the changes to the database.

The ```.sorted``` file (that is, the __original__ clean export file, __not__ the changes) is stored in the ```previous``` folder inside the [Application Settings](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/network-configuration/server-configuration/general-purpose/index.md)directory. It will be used as a reference for the next _incremental_ Prepare-Synchronization to compute the changes, if needed.

Tampering with the ```previous``` folder content would result in false changes leading to false computation. It would result in data corruption in the Identity Manager database. To restore the Identity Manager database and reflect the managed system data updates, a _complete__Sync Up_ would be required.

### Prepare the server

At the beginning of every _Prepare-Synchronization_ process, the _Server_ is notified via HTTP.

Upon receiving the notification, the server creates a directory on its host environment, identified by a unique GUID, to contain ```.sorted``` or ```.sorted.delta``` files that will be sent by the agent.

This is designed to prevent network errors that would cause an _incremental_ database update to happen more than once.

This means that several _Export_ and _Prepare-Synchronization_ tasks can be executed simultaneously. These tasks will be processed by the server one at a time, in the right order.

Any notification of a _complete_ Prepare-Synchronization would cancel the previous non-processed _incremental_ Prepare-Synchronizations. As a _complete_ Prepare-Synchronization reloads the whole database, it renders _incremental_ changes computation moot.

### Send clean exports

```.sorted``` or ```.sorted.delta``` files are sent over HTTP to the _Server_ for the last step.
