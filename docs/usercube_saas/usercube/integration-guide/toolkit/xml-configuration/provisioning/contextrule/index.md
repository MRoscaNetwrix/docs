# Context Rule

A context rule configures, for the identities of a given entity type, the generation of contexts which are used in provisioning to simplify the application of the role model's rules.

A context rule should be created for each entity type for which we want to assign entitlements automatically based on users' attributes.

Without a context rule, automatic entitlements (assigned via the role model's rules):

- cannot be assigned based on users' attributes;
- don't have specific start and end dates, so they are valid from the resource creation until its deletion.

See the [
Identity Lifecycle: Joiners, Movers and Leavers
](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/identity-management/joiners-movers-leavers/index.md) for additional information about context generation.

A context rule can be configured with [
Record Section
](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/recordsection/index.md) in situations where a user needs to be modeled by several contexts over time or simultaneously.
  
Without record sections, a context rule can generate only one context per user. This means that users cannot have more than one contract, or position, at a time, and that data changes cannot be anticipated.

## Examples

The following example generates contexts, i.e. sets of dimension-value pairs, for users from ```Directory_User``` as resources of ```Directory_User:Records```.

Both the start and end dates of the future contexts are defined with C# expressions based on users' contract and position start/end dates.

All contexts are to be made of the properties specified by the bindings ```B0``` to ```B7```.

```

<ContextRule Identifier="Directory_User" DisplayName_L1="Directory_User" Policy="Default" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ResourcesBinding="Records" ResourcesStartExpression="C#:record:return record.StartDate ?? record.PositionStartDate ?? record.ContractStartDate;" ResourcesEndExpression="C#:record:return record.EndDate ?? record.PositionEndDate ?? record.ContractEndDate;"
    B0="Directory_UserRecord:Organization"
    B1="Directory_UserRecord:Title"
    B2="Directory_UserRecord:Site"
    B3="Directory_UserRecord:Site.Region.Country"
    B4="Directory_UserRecord:UserType.Category"
    B5="Directory_UserRecord:Organization.Type"
    B6="Directory_UserRecord:Subsidiary"
    B7="Directory_UserRecord:ExternalCompany"
/>

```

### ExcludeExpression

The following example is similar to the previous one, except that we choose to exclude users declared as "draft" from the role model and provisioning calculations.

```

<ContextRule Identifier="Directory_User" DisplayName_L1="Directory_User" Policy="Default" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ResourcesBinding="Records" ResourcesStartExpression="C#:record:return record.StartDate ?? record.PositionStartDate ?? record.ContractStartDate;" ResourcesEndExpression="C#:record:return record.EndDate ?? record.PositionEndDate ?? record.ContractEndDate;" ExcludeExpression="C#:record:return record.IsDraft.GetValueOrDefault();"
    B0="Directory_UserRecord:Organization"
    B1="Directory_UserRecord:Title"
    B2="Directory_UserRecord:Site"
    B3="Directory_UserRecord:Site.Region.Country"
    B4="Directory_UserRecord:UserType.Category"
    B5="Directory_UserRecord:Organization.Type"
    B6="Directory_UserRecord:Subsidiary"
    B7="Directory_UserRecord:ExternalCompany"
/>

```

This option can exclude workers who are not validated yet, or who have left the company, for example.

### RiskFactorType

The following example is similar to the previous one, except that we force the final risk score of a user to be the maximum value of all their risk scores.

```

<ContextRule Identifier="Directory_User" DisplayName_L1="Directory_User" Policy="Default" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ResourcesBinding="Records" ResourcesStartExpression="C#:record:return record.StartDate ?? record.PositionStartDate ?? record.ContractStartDate;" ResourcesEndExpression="C#:record:return record.EndDate ?? record.PositionEndDate ?? record.ContractEndDate;" ExcludeExpression="C#:record:return record.IsDraft.GetValueOrDefault();" RiskFactorType="Max"
    B0="Directory_UserRecord:Organization"
    B1="Directory_UserRecord:Title"
    B2="Directory_UserRecord:Site"
    B3="Directory_UserRecord:Site.Region.Country"
    B4="Directory_UserRecord:UserType.Category"
    B5="Directory_UserRecord:Organization.Type"
    B6="Directory_UserRecord:Subsidiary"
    B7="Directory_UserRecord:ExternalCompany"
/>

```

### Role mining

Context rules also contain some parameters for [
Perform Role Mining
](/docs/usercube_saas/usercube/user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/role-mining/index.md).

Users are distributed in a hypercube made of all dimensions, like in the following table (left) when we have only 2 dimensions, where for example ```1```, ```2```, ```3```, etc. are users' possible locations, and ```A```, ```B```, ```C```, etc. are users' possible departments in the company. When considering one dimension and sorting the dimension values per user percentage, we get the following table (right).

![Role Mining Tables](/img/product_docs/usercube/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/contextrule/contextrules_rolemining.webp)

The tables here represent a simple situation with few dimensions. But the higher the number of dimensions, the more complex are role mining's computations. This is known as the curse of dimensionality.

The following example is similar to the first one, except that we customize some role mining parameters which help tackle the curse of dimensionality:

- ```MinIdentitiesCount``` establishes that the role mining's engine will generate a role assignment rule only when the rule is applicable to at least 5 users;
- ```ReductionOutlierPercentage``` establishes that the role mining's engine will consider the last 2.0% dimension values (from ```Y``` to ```Z``` in the table above) to be grouped together in a single category "Others".

  The definition of the outlier percentage is particularly useful when managing, for example a services company with thousands of distinct organizations, where many organizations contain only one or two users. We can safely choose to group into a single fictitious organization the 2% of all users that involve the smallest organizations.

```

<ContextRule Identifier="Directory_User" DisplayName_L1="Directory_User" Policy="Default" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ResourcesBinding="Records" ResourcesStartExpression="C#:record:return record.StartDate ?? record.PositionStartDate ?? record.ContractStartDate;" ResourcesEndExpression="C#:record:return record.EndDate ?? record.PositionEndDate ?? record.ContractEndDate;" MinIdentitiesCount="5" ReductionOutlierPercentage="2.0"
    B0="Directory_UserRecord:Organization"
    B1="Directory_UserRecord:Title"
    B2="Directory_UserRecord:Site"
    B3="Directory_UserRecord:Site.Region.Country"
    B4="Directory_UserRecord:UserType.Category"
    B5="Directory_UserRecord:Organization.Type"
    B6="Directory_UserRecord:Subsidiary"
    B7="Directory_UserRecord:ExternalCompany"
/>

```

### Certification items

Unlike ```ResourcesStartBinding``` and ```ResourcesEndBinding```, ```ResourcesStartExpression``` and ```ResourcesEndExpression``` cannot be used to define the resources to include in the related certification campaigns. Thus, when needing to define which resources to include with more than start/end bindings, add a comparison based on ```ResourceCertificationComparisonBinding```, ```ResourceCertificationComparisonOperator``` and ```ResourceCertificationComparisonValue```.

The following example includes in certification campaigns only the resources that have their ```IsActivePosition``` property set to ```1```.

```

<ContextRule Identifier="Directory_User" DisplayName_L1="Directory_User" Policy="Default" ResourcesBinding="Records" ResourcesStartExpression="C#:record:return record.StartDate ?? record.PositionStartDate ?? record.ContractStartDate;" ResourcesEndExpression="C#:record:return record.EndDate ?? record.PositionEndDate ?? record.ContractEndDate;" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ExcludeExpression="C#:record:return record.IsDraft.GetValueOrDefault();" RiskFactorType="Max" ResourceCertificationComparisonBinding="Directory_UserRecord:IsActivePosition" ResourceCertificationComparisonOperator="Equal" ResourceCertificationComparisonValue="1"
    B0="Directory_UserRecord:Organization"
    B1="Directory_UserRecord:Title"
    B2="Directory_UserRecord:Site"
    B3="Directory_UserRecord:Site.Region.Country"
    B4="Directory_UserRecord:UserType.Category"
    B5="Directory_UserRecord:Organization.Type"
    B6="Directory_UserRecord:Subsidiary"
    B7="Directory_UserRecord:ExternalCompany" 
/>

```

__Note:__ must be configured together with the other ```ResourceCertificationComparison``` properties.

__Note:__ when not specified, certification items are defined by ```ResourcesStartBinding``` and ```ResourcesStartBinding```.
