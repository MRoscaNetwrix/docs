# Base32 Parameter Names

## Base32 Parameter Names

Some attributes names in the applicative configuration, such a those related to dimensions identification, are written using a [Base32 representation of numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32).

Identity Manager uses flavor of base32 known as __base32hex__ described in the [RFC4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#RFC4648).

It uses 10 digits from 0 to 9 and 22 letters from A to V to represent numbers.

The following table shows the decimal - base32hex equivalent for the first 127 numbers.

For example, dimensions are identified by a number going from 0 to 127 in decimal representation and 0 to 3V in base32hex representation.

The [
Context Rule
](/docs/product_docs/usercube_saas/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/contextrule/index.md) support _128_ dimension parameters going from ```B0``` to ```B3V``` using the __base32hex__```0``` to ```3V``` numbers to identify a dimension.
