# appsettings.connection

## Define configuration through UI

On some configuration screens, such as the connector screen, it is possible to define some of the [
Agent Configuration
](../../agent-configuration/index.md). This configuration is stored in the __appsettings.connection.json__ file, located inside the [Application Settings](../../agent-configuration/appsettings/index.md) work folder.

The __appsettings.connection.json__ file has the exact same structure as the other [appsettings.agent](../../agent-configuration/appsettings-agent/index.md) file.

This configuration file has the highest priority among others agent's configuration sources . See the [
Agent Configuration
](../../agent-configuration/index.md) topic for additional information.

You should not modify this file manually.
