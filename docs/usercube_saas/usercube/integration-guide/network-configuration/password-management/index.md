# Password Management

The Password Management module offers a set of password-related operations on resources of certain
types (Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Microsoft Azure AD), Service Now, etc...).

## Possible Password Operations

Depending on the target system of the manipulated resource, the following operations are possible:

### Password initialization

This operation **can be started manually by the user through the UI** (with the "Manage Accounts"
option on user pages) **or automatically during the fulfillment process** of the corresponding
resource.

It consists of initializing the password and sending a notification containing instructions to a
configurable email address.

The password initialization can be done in two different ways:

- One-Way: Identity Manager sets the initial password, and sends it as part of the instructions
  notification.
- Two-Way: The instructions notification contains a link to a page where the email recipient
  initializes the password.

### Password change

**UI-only** operation that allows the user to change the password.

### Password reset

**UI-only** operation that allows the user to reset the password.

### Account unlocking

**UI-only** operation that allows the user to unlock an account that has been blocked due to too
many incorrect password attempts.

## Possible operations per managed system

Identity Manager provides a predefined set of possible operations per managed system (which cannot
be changed by the configuration).
