# Simulation

Simulations aim to assess the impact of a modification in the role model, i.e. any modification of a role or rule, before it is applied.

## Overview

Identity Manager's simulations gather roles and rules which are to be created, modified or deleted, without being inserted in the actual role model straight away. More specifically, a simulation can involve:

- [
  Resource Correlation Rule
  ](../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcecorrelationrule/index.md) and [
  Resource Classification Rule
  ](../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourceclassificationrule/index.md);
- Scalar rules and navigation rules;
- [Resource Type](../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.md) rules;
- [
  Single Role
  ](../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md) and [
  Composite Role
  ](../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerole/index.md);
- [Single Role Rule](../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.md)and [Composite Role Rule](../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/compositerolerule/index.md).

A simulation can also be created by the role mining tool for the automation of role assignments. See the [
Perform Role Mining
](../../user-guide/optimize/assignment-automation/role-mining/index.md) topic for additional information.

Through simulation, integrators can:

1. create, modify or delete roles and rules in a given policy;

   Only one simulation can be active per policy.
2. observe via simulation reports the impact on the whole system, i.e. both assignments and provisioning results, before the changes are applied;
3. decide to confirm or cancel changes.

Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube) recommends using simulation whenever performing an action (creation/modification/deletion) on the role model.
