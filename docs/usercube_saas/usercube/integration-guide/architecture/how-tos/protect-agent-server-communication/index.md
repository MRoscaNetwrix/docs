# Protect Agent/Server Communication

This guide shows how to set up a secured authentication system between Identity Manager's agent and
server.

## Overview

Identity Manager provides a simple way to protect the communication between agent and server, using
OpenID Connect.

First, make sure to understand the OpenID protocol. For example,
[see Microsoft's documentation on the matter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc).

The idea, when sending data from the agent to the server, is the following:

1. the agent decrypts its own data which was encrypted with the agent-side certificate;
2. the agent calls the server, and sends its HTTPS-encrypted message;
3. the server receives and decrypts the message, before encrypting it again with its own encryption
   certificate configured by Identity Manager.

### Configuration details

The server must be configured, in its `appsettings.json`, with:

- an encryption certificate with the private and public keys, in order to be able to send signed
  tokens.

The agent must be configured, in its `appsettings.json`, with:

- an encryption certificate with at least the server's public key, in order to be able to verify the
  tokens sent by the server;
- another encryption certificate meant to encrypt specific files such as logs or temporary files;
- an SSL encryption certificate for the HTTPS connection.

    The SSL certificate is required when working in an on-premises environment. In a SaaS
    environment, Identity Manager provides it.

In order to give to the agent the right permissions, the XML configuration must specify an
[ OpenIdClient ](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/openidclient/index.md) linked to
its hashed secret, and to a Identity Manager profile.

## Protect Agent/Server Communication

Protect agent/server communication by proceeding as follows:

1. Make sure that both the agent and server configurations specify an encryption certificate. See
   the
   [Application Settings](../../../network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings/index.md)
   for additional information.

    > For example:
    >
    > ```
    >
    > appsettings.json
    >
    > {
    >   "IdentityServer": {
    >       "X509KeyFilePath": "./Usercube.pfx",
    >       "X509KeyFilePassword": "secret"
    >   },
    >   ...
    > }
    >
    > ```

2. Make sure that the agent is also configured with its own encryption certificate. See the
   [Application Settings](../../../network-configuration/agent-configuration/appsettings/index.md)
   for additional information.

    > For example:
    >
    > ```
    >
    > appsettings.json
    >
    > {
    >   "EncryptionCertificate": {
    >       "File": "./Usercube-Files.pfx",
    >       "Password": "secret",
    >       "EncryptFile": true
    >   },
    >   ...
    > }
    >
    > ```

3. Configure an OpenIdClient, both on agent side in `appsettings.agent.json` with the non-hashed
   secret and on server side in the XML configuration with the secret hashed by the
   [ Usercube-New-OpenIDSecret ](../../../executables/references/new-openidsecret/index.md)
   executable. See the
   [ OpenIdClient ](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/openidclient/index.md) for
   additional information.

    > For example on agent side:
    >
    > ```
    >
    > appsettings.agent.json
    >
    > {
    >   "OpenId": {
    >       "OpenIdClients": {
    >           "Job": "newSecret"
    >       },
    >       ...
    >   }
    >   ...
    > }
    >
    > ```
    >
    > And on server side:
    >
    > ```
    >
    > ./Usercube-New-OpenIDSecret.exe --client-secret secret
    >
    > ```
    >
    > `<OpenIdClient Identifier="Job" HashedSecret="K7gNU3sdo+OL0wNhqoVWhr3g6s1xYv72ol/pe/Unols=" DisplayName_L1="Permissions for jobs" Profile="Administrator" />`
    >
    > ```
    >
    > ```
