# Add-Ons

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) can manipulate Firefox add-ons by enabling and
disabling add-ons of all types. Endpoint Policy Manager can also force the installation of or force
the removal of specific add-ons. To find Firefox's add-ons, select "Add-ons" within Firefox, as
shown in Figure 15.
