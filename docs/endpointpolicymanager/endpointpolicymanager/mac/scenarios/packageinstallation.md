# Package Installation Policy

**NOTE:** See the
[Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager for Macs Application Package Support](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/endpointpolicymanager/video/leastprivilege/mac/applicationpackage.md)
video for an overview of this section.

When a standard user attempts to install a .PKG file they are not allowed to do so. In this example,
Skype for Business prompts the user for admin credentials before installing.
