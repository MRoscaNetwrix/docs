# Elevating Java JAR Files

**NOTE:** For an overview on elevating JAR files and also preventing .JAR files from running, which
could need admin rights, see the
[Elevate (or smack down) scripts and Java JAR files](/docs/endpointpolicymanager/video/leastprivilege/elevate/scripts.md)
video.

You can use Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Least Privilege Manager to elevate a Java
JAR file, or block it from running, in order to prevent attacks that originate over email or on USB
flash drives.

To start making rules for Java JAR files right-click in the window and select **Add** > **New Java
(JAR) Policy**.
