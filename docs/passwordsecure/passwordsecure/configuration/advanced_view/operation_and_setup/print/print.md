Firstly, it is necessary to select whether you want to print a table or a detailed view. The amount of data can also be defined. The individual menu items are described in detail further down in this section. After making your selection, the data is firstly prepared for printing. Depending on the amount of data, this may take a few minutes. The print preview is then opened.

NOTE: The print preview accesses the functions of the printer driver. Depending on the printer or driver being used, the appearance and functions offered by the print preview may vary. The individual functions will thus not be described in detail here.

The printing process is ultimately started via the __print preview__. It is also possible to save the view or adjust the layout before printing.

#### Selecting the data to be printed

There are different options available for adapting the printing result to your personal requirements. The individual menu items will be explained here using the example of printing passwords.

###### Table view (current selection)

All __selected__ records will be printed out. In the following example, __Adobe__ and __Anibis.ch__ are thus printed out.

![selected data](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_46-en.webp)

The data is printed here in table form.

![print password](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_47-en.webp)

#### Tableview (current filter)

All currently __filtered__ records will be printed out here. In this example, all seven records are thus printed out.

![filtered password](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_48-en.webp)

They are printed out – as described above – in table form.

#### Detailed view (current selection)

This option also prints out the currently selected records. However, a detailed view is printed out in this case.

![print filtered passwords](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_49-en.webp)

#### Detailed view (current filter)

This function can be used to print out all filtered records in detailed view as described above.

NOTE: It should be noted that the amount of data generated via this function can quickly become very large.
