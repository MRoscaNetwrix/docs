# Keyboard shortcuts

## Functionality

Some actions can be executed very efficiently using keyboard shortcuts. These are configured in the section of the same name within the __global [User settings](/docs/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/user_settings/user_settings.md)__

The following keyboard shortcuts are available:

- __CTRL+ ALT + U__ transfers the user name from the selected record to the active window
- __CTRL+ ALT + S__ starts a script that firstly transfers the user name from the selected record to the active window. The shortcut will then execute a TAB jump and transfer the password.
- __CTRL+ ALT + P__ enters the selected password into the active window or field
- __CTRL+ ALT + R__ firstly transfers the user name from the selected record to the active window via the enter key. The shortcut will then execute a TAB jump and transfer the password.
