# Administration

## Sessions

Via the menu item __Sessions__, all users connected to the database can be displayed. This page is purely informative in character and thus no configurations can be made here.

The session view starts in the currently active module in a separate tab.

#### Locked users

All currently locked users can also be retrieved. There are two scenarios here:

1. User name correct, password incorrect: The user name is displayed
2. User name incorrect: The client is displayed

In addition, the number of attempted logins and the length of time that the user was locked in each case can be seen.

#### Default password rules

Password rules can be defined for both user passwords and also for WebViewer exports that then need to be fulfilled. In the following example, a user password must correspond to the “default password” rule in order to be valid
