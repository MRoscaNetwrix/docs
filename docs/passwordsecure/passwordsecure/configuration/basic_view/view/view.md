# View

## The view of the Basic view

The Basic view interface is arranged in tiles. If a logo/icon has been stored for a password in the image management, this can optionally be displayed with the associated data record. If the logo of the password is not available, a reduced Outlook view is displayed.

## Mouseover

As with add-ons, the control button is displayed as soon as you hover the mouse over the corresponding elements. This process is known as "mouseover".

## Image management

Usually, the setup of logos/icons in the i__mage management__ is done by the in-house administration. You can learn more about this in the FullClient [Image management](../../advanced_view/mainmenu/extras/image_management/image_manager.md) documentation.
