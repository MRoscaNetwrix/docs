# Security

#### Your security is our ambition

Security is a top priority for Netwrix Password Secure - right from the conception stage, it sets the course for all further developments. Of course, security was also taken into account during the development of the Netwrix Password Secure app and the latest technologies were used. The following encryption techniques and algorithms are currently used:

Global

- AES 256 / RSA 4096 encrypted
- PBKDF2 with up to 100,000 iterations
- End to end encrypted (like all Netwrix Password Secure App Clients)
- No direct connection to Netwrix Password Secure Server required. Connection is via web server.
- MDM (Mobile Device Management) support
- Passwords can be used offline when server access is not available
- Fast incremental data synchronization
- Easy connection between Netwrix Password Secure Mobile Apps and the server via QR code
- Easy navigation between private and shared passwords
- Automatic reconciliation of data using real-time updates
- Two-factor authentication
- Synchronization with multiple databases possible
- Expiration date of databases to ensure automatic deletion
- Server and app side security settings. Who is allowed to use the app and to what extent?

iOS

- Full support of FaceID and TouchID for passwordless login to the Netwrix Password Secure Mobile app.
- Password AutoFill support. Passwords are automatically entered in other apps and Safari. (No copy/paste or typing)
