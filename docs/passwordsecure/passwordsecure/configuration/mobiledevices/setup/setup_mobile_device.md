# Setup

## Requirements

Netwrix Password Secure Mobile Apps automatically synchronize with an existing Netwrix Password Secure database. The [Web Application](/docs/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/web_application.md) is used as the interface for this. This must therefore be installed. In addition, the database must be enabled for use with mobile devices on the [Server Manager](/docs/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/server_manager/server_manger.md).

#### Setup and configuration

The setup and initial configuration of the __Netwrix Password Secure App__ is explained in the following chapters:

- [Installation of the App / Requirements](/docs/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/mobiledevices/setup/installation_app/installation_of_the_app.md)
- [Linking the database](/docs/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/mobiledevices/setup/linking_database/linking_the_database.md)
