# Changes in the Server Manager

#### Navigation

In the previous on-prem version, there are the modules Databases (1) and Backups (2).

In the new MSP version these have been replaced by the modules Customers (1) and Cost Overview (2).

![AdminClient - MSP module](../../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/module-msp-ac-en.webp)

In the MSP version, you will find the individual customer databases under the Customers module.

NOTE: The Backup module has been removed, because Netwrix Password Secure's own backup is not
suitable for environments with multiple customer databases. As a Managed Service Provider, you must
back up your customer databases yourself using appropriate measures.

The Status and Web Application modules are identical in both versions.
