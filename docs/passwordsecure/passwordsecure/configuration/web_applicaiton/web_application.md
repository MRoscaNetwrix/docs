# Web Application

## What is the Web Application

The previous WebAccess function has been replaced by the __Web Application‚Äù in Netwrix Password Secure version__ __8.3.0. The completely newly developed \*Web Application__ will act as the basis for the constant enhancement of the functional scope. The desired objective is to also provide the full functional scope of the client in the Web Application. The __Web Application__ will thus be constantly enhanced. All of the currently available functions can be viewed in the [Functional scope](/docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/functional_scope/functional_scope.md) section.

__Netwrix Password Secure Web Application__ enables platform-independent access to the database via a browser. It is irrelevant whether you are using Microsoft Windows, macOS or Linux, it is only necessary for javascript to be supported. As the __Netwrix Password Secure Web Application__ has a responsive design, it can also be used on all mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.

The __Web Application__ is based both optically and also in its operation on the Netwrix Password Secure client. As usual, users can only access the data for which they also have permissions. The installation is described in the section [Installation Web Application](/docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/installation/installation_web_application/installation_web_application.md)
