# Google Chrome

## Installing the add-on

The installation of the Google Chrome Add-on is done directly from the Google Store. You can access
it via the following link:
[Add-on for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netwrix-password-secure/bpjfchmapbmjeklgmlkabfepflgfckip).

Alternatively, you can also access the Google Store via the Autofill Add-on. To do this, right-click
the icon to open the context menu. After a further click on Install Browser Extensions the Google
Chrome Add-on can be selected, whereupon you will be redirected directly to the Google Store.

The installation is started via Add.

The add-on is now installed and the icon is added to the browser.

NOTE: It is also possible to find the Add-on link in the Web Application page footer, if it is not
installed yet.
