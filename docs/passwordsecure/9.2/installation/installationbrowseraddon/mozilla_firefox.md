# Mozilla Firefox

## Installing the add-on

The installation of the Firefox Add-on is done directly from the official Store. The Firefox Add-on
can be downloaded from the following link:
[Add-on firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-safe-browser-add-on/).

After the download, the add-on is simply dragged and dropped into the browser.

After confirming a security question, it is installed and an icon is created in the menu bar.

NOTE: It is also possible to find the Add-on link in the Web Application page footer, if it is not
installed yet
