# Automatic backup cleanup

It is possible to delete backups automatically after a certain period of time. This can be useful if
you append date and time to the backups and thus generate new files daily.

###### Requirement

**CAUTION:** It must be ensured that the user who sets up the automated deletion has sysadmin
privileges on the SQL server.

###### Furnishing

To be able to use the automatic cleanup, it must be activated first.

For a proper function of the automatic deletion, the following must be defined:

- the age of the backups which have to be deleted
- the SQL instance
- all paths where the automatic cleanup of the backup files is to be performed.
