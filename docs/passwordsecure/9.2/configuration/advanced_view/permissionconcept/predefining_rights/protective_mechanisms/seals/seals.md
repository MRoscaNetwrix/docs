# Seals

## What are seals?

Passwords are selectively made available to the different user groups by means of the
[Authorization and protection mechanisms](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/web_applicaiton/authorization_and_protection/authorization_and_protection_mechanisms.md).
Nevertheless, there are many scenarios in which the ability to view and use a record should be
linked to a release issued in advance. In this context, the seal is an effective protective
mechanism. This multi-eye principle protects passwords by securing them with granular release
mechanisms. If you want to see a password, this must be requested and released. The release can also
be temporary.

## Relevant rights

The following option is required to add a seal.

## User right

- Can add seal

## Required permissions

Firstly, the user must have the **authorize permission** for the record in order to create seals.
The read permission to all users and roles that are contained in the seal is also required. The
exact configuration of password masking and permissions for records is described in detail in the
Authorization concept section.

## What exactly is sealed?

Technically speaking, the password itself is not sealed. It is the permission to see a password
field that is protected by a seal. This allows for the most sensitive configurations, in which one
group can use the password without restrictions, but the same password is sealed for other users.
The wizard assists users in applying seals, as well as in future maintenance.

**CAUTION:** The complete data set is never sealed! Only the permission to view a password is
protected by a seal.

**CAUTION:** Be Aware" Only records that are protected with a password can be sealed!

## Seal wizard

All seal configurations are performed in the wizard. Both the application of new seals as well as
the processing and removing are possible. The current state of a seal can also be viewed in an
overview, which is accessible via the button in the ribbon. When the seal wizard is opened via the
ribbon, the wizard appears in the case of unsealed data sets, which runs in **four steps** through
the configuration of the seal.

#### 1. Apply seal

![multi-eye principe](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/seals_2-en.webp)

All objects that are sealed are displayed at the beginning. Depending on the data record, this can
be one object, or several. It is also possible to use existing
[Seal templates](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/extras/seal_templates/seal_templates.md). Optionally, you can
enter a reason for each seal.

#### 2. Multi-eye principle

The seal logic is the most basic element of this protective mechanism. Here, you define for which
users or roles the record should be sealed or released in the future. All those for whom the record
is to be sealed are displayed in red, while all users with the required permissions to issue a
release are displayed in blue.

![example permissions](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/seals_3-en.webp)

NOTE: All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for
release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal.

To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the
authorizations of the data record. Compare with the "permissions" for the record (can be viewed via
the ribbon).

![example permissions](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/seals_4-en.webp)

Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the
existing authorizations. The following **scheme** is used:

NOTE: All users and roles that have the **authorize permission** to the record are "authorized to
issue a release" for the seal by default. All users and roles that do not have the **authorize
permissions** to the record are copied directly into the "Sealed for" column.

Here is a closer look at the permissions of the role **Administrators** on the record:

![example multi-eye principe](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/seals_5-en.webp)

## Adjusting the seal logic

Although standard authorizations are used as a basis for the sealing concept, these can be adapted.
The number of releases generally required is as configurable as the required number of releases from
a role. In the following example, the seal has been extended so that a total of three release
authorizations are required in order to release the seal **(Multi-eye principle)**. The role of the
administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one
release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators
must grant at least one release.

![edit seal](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/seals_6-en.webp)

In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also
be added to the seal. The role accounting under "sealed for" has been added below.

![define permission for the seal](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/seals_7-en.webp)

NOTE: When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record
according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under "Sealed for" receives
the **Read permission** on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include
the **Read**, **Write**, **Delete**, and **Authorize** permission.

**CAUTION:** All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal
logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record!

NOTE: It is possible to seal records for a user who is also authorized to issue a release. In this
constellation, it is important to ensure that at least one other user is authorized to issue a
release. In principle, you should never be able to issue a release for yourself.

#### 3. Advanced settings

Advanced seal settings allow you to adjust the multi-eye principle. Both the time validity of a
release request as well as a granted release can be configured. Multiple break defines whether after
the breaking of a seal by a user, other users may still break it.

#### 4. Saving the seal

Before closing the wizard, it is possible to save the configuration for later use in the form of a
template. [Seal templates](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/extras/seal_templates/seal_templates.md) can be
optionally provided with a description for the purpose of overview.

## Summary

The permissions already present on the data set form the basis for any complex seal configurations.
It is freely definable which users have to go through a release mechanism before accessing the
password. The roles, which may be granted, are freely definable. An always accessible
[Seal overview](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/seals_overview/seal_overview.md) allows all authorized persons to view the current
state of the seals. The section on the[Release mechanism](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/predefining_rights/protective_mechanisms/seals/release_mechanism/release_mechanism.md)
describes in detail the individual steps, from the initial release request to the final release.
