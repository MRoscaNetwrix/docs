# User management

## How are the users managed in the Web Application?

The user management strongly depends on whether the Active Directory has been connected or not. In
Master Key mode, the Active Directory remains the leading system. In all other modes, the user
administration is carried out via the organisational structure module.

#### Creating local users

When creating new users, you must pay attention to whether it is a **User (Basic View)** or a
**Advanced User (View)**.
