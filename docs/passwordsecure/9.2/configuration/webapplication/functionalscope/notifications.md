# Notifications

- The **permission module** exists of the following features:
- Filter function
- Seal function
- Mark message as read/unread
- Quick view (use button and space bar)

The Web Application module permissions is based on the same called client module notifications. Both
modules differ in range and design. However, the handling is almost the same.
