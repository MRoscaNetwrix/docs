# Filter or structure area

As is also the case on the client, it is possible to select between filter and structure. For this
purpose, the following buttons are available on the navigation bar

1. Filter

The filter on the Web Application is based on the
[Filter](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/advancedview/operationandsetup/filter/filter.md). Therefore, only those
characteristics specific to the Web Application will be described here.

Using the filter

Operation of the “Web Application filter” barely differs from the operation of the client filter. It
is only necessary to note that the Clear filter and Apply filter buttons can be found above the
filter. The configuration settings can also be found directly above the Web Application filter.

Configuring the filter

The configuration for the filter can be displayed via the following buttons:

New filter groups can be added using **Add filter groups** and the current filter can be reset using
**Reset filter. Advanced mode** provides you with the possibility of deleting or moving individual
filter groups. The **Allow negation of filters** option can also be selected.

2. Structure

The structure can be operated in precisely the same way as on the client.
