# Setting up autofill

The most important comfort feature of the Netwrix Password Secure App is probably the autofill, i.e.
the possibility to enter access data directly into the input mask. The autofill must first be set up
or configured.

#### Setting up the autofill under iOS

In the settings, first select the item Passwords & Accounts and then Automatically fill in. As soon
as Auto-fill is activated, all options for filling in login windows are offered. Here one then
selects Netwrix Password Secure.

RECOMMENDED: We recommend deactivating the **keychain (iOS)** as well as any other apps offered to
prevent misunderstandings in usage.

#### Setting up automatic registration on Android

In the settings under Operating aids ยน, among the downloaded services, the Netwrix Password Secure
app is activated.

In addition, you must define in the settings under Show via other apps that Netwrix Password Secure
may be shown via other apps.

RECOMMENDED: We recommend to use only Netwrix Password Secure for automatic registration and to
deactivate all other apps here. This prevents possible misunderstandings in the operation.
