# Setup

## Requirements

Netwrix Password Secure Mobile Apps automatically synchronize with an existing Netwrix Password
Secure database. The [Web Application](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/webapplication/web_application.md) is used as the
interface for this. This must therefore be installed. In addition, the database must be enabled for
use with mobile devices on the [Server Manager](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/servermanger/server_manger.md).

#### Setup and configuration

The setup and initial configuration of the **Netwrix Password Secure App** is explained in the
following chapters:

- [Installation of the App / Requirements](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/mobiledevices/setupmobiledevice/installation_of_the_app.md)
- [Linking the database](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/mobiledevices/setupmobiledevice/linking_the_database.md)
- [Biometric login](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/mobiledevices/setupmobiledevice/biometric_login.md)
- [Setting up autofill](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/mobiledevices/setupmobiledevice/setting_up_autofill.md)
