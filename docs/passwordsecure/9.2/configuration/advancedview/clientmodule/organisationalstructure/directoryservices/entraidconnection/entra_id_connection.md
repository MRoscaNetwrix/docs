# Microsoft Entra ID connection

More and more companies use cloud services. Therefore, also the management of users is outsourced.
Instead of a classic Active Directory via LDAP, an Entra ID is used more often. Netwrix Password
Secure integrates the possibility to bring in users and roles from Azure. To use users and roles
from multiple Entra IDs, you can create multiple profiles.

## Introduction

## Why Entra ID?

More and more companies use cloud services. Therefore, also the management of users is outsourced.
Instead of a classic Active Directory via LDAP, an Entra ID is used more often. Netwrix Password
Secure integrates the possibility to bring in users and roles from Azure. To use users and roles
from multiple Entra IDs, you can create multiple profiles.

Remember, In order to use Azure login with the windows application,
[WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-edge/webview2/) from Microsoft must be
installed on the client device.

### Differences to the LDAP connection

The connection to the Entra ID differs in one special point from the connection to a conventional
Active Directory. While Netwrix Password Secure queries the users, groups, and roles actively from
the conventional AD, the Entra ID is pushing them automatically to our server. For this a so-called
[SCIM service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_for_Cross-domain_Identity_Management) is used.

To login to Netwrix Password Secure, after entering the username a popup opens for the
authentication with the entered Microsoft account. Here, a possible configured second factor is also
requested. The authentication is handled via the
[Open ID Connect protocol](https://openid.net/connect/).

### Linking Entra ID

Below you will find instructions on how to connect Entra ID to Netwrix Password Secure. In the Azure
portal, go to the management page of your Microsoft Entra ID. Use an account with administrative
permissions for this. During this, login to Netwrix Password Secure with an account that has the
user right "Display organisational structure module", "Can manage Entra ID profiles", and "Can
create new Entra ID profiles" enabled.

## Setup

### New enterprise application

Login to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#azure-portal) and go to the management page of
your Microsoft Entra ID.

NOTE: You need an account with administrative permissions

- Write down your "Tenant ID" shown in the Azure console or by using PowerShell:


```
Connect-AzureAD

```

- Navigate in your Entra ID to "Enterprise applications"
- Add an own application, that is not listed in the Azure Gallery – in our example, we name it
  "Netwrix Password Secure"

NOTE: A key feature of Netwrix Password Secure is, that it is self-hosted by our customers. However,
to be listed in Azure Gallery, a SaaS model is required. Therefore, Netwrix Password Secure is not
available in the Azure Gallery.

- When the application was created successfully, you are redirected to it automatically
- Write down the "Application ID"
- In the navigation, click "Users and groups"
- Add the Users and groups that should be available to Netwrix Password Secure

**CAUTION:** The import of Azure groups as Netwrix Password Secure roles is only possible if you
have booked the Azure package Entra ID Premium P1!

- Navigate to the "Provisioning" page
- Configure the Provisioning Mode to "Automatic"

### Netwrix Password Secure Entra ID configuration

NOTE: Your Netwrix Password Secure user need the following permissions:


```
- Display organisational structure module
- Can manage Azure AD profiles
- Can create new Azure AD profiles

```

- Navigate to the module "Organisational structure"
- In the toolbar, click on "Manage profiles" in the category "Entra ID"
- Create the profile with your information
- Insert the `Tenant ID` and the `Application ID`
- As soon as the profile has been saved, a popup opens for generating a token
- Choose a desired expiration date (max. 10 years) and click "Generate token"
- Write down the values of the fields "Tenant URL" and "Secret Token"

### Azure provisioning configuration

Fill the fields "Tenant URL" and "Secret Token" with the information provided by Netwrix Password
Secure Click "Test Connection" When the test has been successful, click on "Save" at the top of the
page Back on the "Provisioning" page, click "Start provisioning" In the settings of the
provisioning, check if "Provisioning Status" is set to "On" All allocated users and groups are
created in Netwrix Password Secure now

NOTE: Azure´s default provisioning interval is 40 Minutes. So it may some time until the users and
roles are shown in Netwrix Password Secure.

**CAUTION:** Please note that Azure establishes the connection to Netwrix Password Secure. For this,
the client URL must be accessible from an external network / provisioning agent and any used SSL
certificate must be valid! If the users are not created in Netwrix Password Secure, consult the
Azure Enterprise Application Provisioning log for more information.
