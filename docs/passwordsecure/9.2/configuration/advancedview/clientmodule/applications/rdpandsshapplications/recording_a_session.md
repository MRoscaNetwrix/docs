# Recording a session

## What is session recording?

Session recording can be used to make a visual recording of RDP and SSH sessions. These recordings
can then be subsequently viewed and evaluated. In this context, it is also possible to limit this
functionality so that only the user themselves or an assigned person e.g. security officer can view
and evaluate these recordings.

## Relevant rights

The following options are required to manage sessions for an application.

### User right

- Can manage recordings for an application

NOTE: Please note that session recording uses disk space in the database. Although the way the
recordings are saved is efficient in terms of resources, the required amount of disk space varies
greatly depending on the content. The more that is done during the recorded session, the higher the
disk space usage.

Session recording firstly needs to be activated for the relevant RDP or SSH application before it
can take place.

RDP

SSH

If the setting has been activated, the recording will start automatically the next time a connection
is established.

NOTE: The recordings are already streamed to the server and saved into the database during the
recording process. Therefore, no recordings are lost even if the connection is terminated. They are
immediately saved until the connection is terminated or until the end of the session.

## Viewing the session recordings

If recordings exist for an application, these can be called up and viewed in the Applications
module.

It is possible to search the session recordings using the filter as usual. It is also possible here
to limit the search results based on the date and user. In the section on the right, it is also
possible to further filter the searched list based on all column contents.

Once a session recording has been selected, a new tab will open in which you can view the recording.
The function "Skip inactivity" can be activated via the ribbon so that a recording can be
effectively and quickly viewed so as only to see the relevant actions.

When are indicators set?

- Mouse click
- Keyboard command

## Automatic deletion of old recordings

If desired, recordings can be automatically cleaned up. This option can be configured on the
**Server Manager**. Further information can be found in the section
[Managing databases](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/configuration/servermanger/managingdatabases/managing_databases.md)s.
