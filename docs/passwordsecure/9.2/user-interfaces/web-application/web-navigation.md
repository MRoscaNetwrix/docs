# Filter or structure area

As is also the case on the client, it is possible to select between filter and structure. For this
purpose, the following buttons are available on the navigation bar

![installation_with_parameters_169](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/filter_or_structure/installation_with_parameters_169.webp)

1. Filter

The filter on the Web Application is based on the
[Filter](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/advanced-view/search-filter.md). Therefore, only those
characteristics specific to the Web Application will be described here.

Using the filter

Operation of the “Web Application filter” barely differs from the operation of the client filter. It
is only necessary to note that the Clear filter and Apply filter buttons can be found above the
filter. The configuration settings can also be found directly above the Web Application filter.

Configuring the filter

The configuration for the filter can be displayed via the following buttons:

![installation_with_parameters_170](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/filter_or_structure/installation_with_parameters_170.webp)

New filter groups can be added using **Add filter groups** and the current filter can be reset using
**Reset filter. Advanced mode** provides you with the possibility of deleting or moving individual
filter groups. The **Allow negation of filters** option can also be selected.

2. Structure

The structure can be operated in precisely the same way as on the client.

# Footer

The footer displays various different information about the currently selected record in multiple
tabs. It can be activated or deactivated using the small arrow on the far right. The footer is
hidden by default.

![installation_with_parameters_178](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/footer/installation_with_parameters_178.webp)

1. Notification area

The notification area shows who last had access to the record. The users are displayed using
corresponding icons or their avatars. Clicking on the user will display their rights.

2. Logbook

You can view the last log entries about the record in the logbook tab.

3. History

The history can also be displayed via a corresponding tab.

4. Documents

The documents tab can be used to access all linked documents.

5. Notifications

This tab shows who has subscribed to receive notifications about the record.

6. Password Resets

The Password Resets that have been performed can also be listed.

# Header

The header provides the following functions:

![Header](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/header/installation_with_parameters_171-en_679x38.webp)

1. Logo

The logo acts as a home button. It always takes you back to the standard view.

2. Display and hide filter

As is also the case on the client, the filter or structure area can be displayed and hidden.

3. Modules

As is also the case on the client, modules like passwords, organisational structures, roles and
forms can be managed here.

4. Quick search

The quick search offers you the same functions as the quick search on the client. It searches in all
fields of the complete database except the password field. The tags are still searched.

5. Quick search

Upcoming tasks like export, import, print and so on are displayed here.

6. Notifications

here you will be informed about incoming notifications. The notification can also be called up by
clicking on it.

7. Account

The user who is currently logged in can be seen under account. You can log out by clicking on the
account. It is also possible to call up the settings in
[Account](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/administration/user-management/user-settings.md).

# List view

## What is list view?

The central element of the navigation in the Web Application is list view, which clearly presents
the filtered elements. As list view in the Web Application provides the same functions as list view
in the client, we refer you at this point to the
[List view](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/advanced-view/list-view.md) section.

![installation_with_parameters_176](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/list_view/installation_with_parameters_176.webp)

#### Special features

The list view differs from that on the client in the following areas:

- List view cannot be individually configured
- There are – as is usual in a browser – no context menus

# Menu

## What is the menu?

The ribbon on the client has been replaced by a menu on the Web Application. The menu thus
represents the central operating element on the Web Application. The functions available within the
menu are dynamic and are based on the currently available actions. Different actions are possible
depending on which view is currently being used.

#### Menu bar

The menu can take on two forms. In general, the **menu bar** containing the **most important
functions** is displayed. It will be described here using the example of the password module.

![menu bar](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/menu_bar/installation_with_parameters_174-en.webp)

1. Expand menu

The size of the menu can be maximised using this button.

2. New

This option can be selected to call up the wizard for adding a new record.

3. Open

Displays the selected password and all of its details in the reading pane.

4. Reveal

Reveals the password.

5. Permissions

This button is used to configure the rights for the record.

6. Password

Copies the password to the clipboard.

###### Advanced menu

If the menu – as described above – is maximised, **all functions** are then available. The functions
on the menu bar are repeated here. The menu is divided into a number of sections. These correspond 1
to 1 to the sections of the ribbon on the client.

![Menu](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/menu_bar/installation_with_parameters_175-en.webp)

In our example, the menu looks like this:

1. New Item

This section offers you more options for editing passwords. These include, for example, **Open** or
also **Delete**.

2. Actions

The actions can be used, for example, to mark the password as a Favourite or also to Duplicate it.

3. Permissions

This section does not offer any additional functions than simply opening the permissions.

4. Clipboard

This section can be used to copy all available fields to the clipboard.

5. Start

A website can be called up here.

NOTE: As already described, the menu is dynamic and thus appears in a variety of different forms.
However, the basic function is always the same: The menu bar contains the basis functions, while the
advanced menu contains all functions.

6. Extras

All of the additional functions can be found here. These functions correspond to the main client and
will be described in the next section:

[Passwords](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/core-features/password-management/passwords-overview.md)

7. Password Reset

The functions of the
[Password Reset](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/core-features/password-reset/password-reset-overview.md) can be found
here.

# Navigation bar

The navigation bar provides the following functions.

![navigation bar](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/navigation_bar/installation_with_parameters_172-en_643x142.webp)

1. Filter

This function can be used to switch the view to the filter in the left section. You also have the
possibility to switch from filter to structure.

2. Tabs

The Tabs represent a secondary navigation function within the Web Application. For each action you
will do a new tab will be opend.

Example

![tab system](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/navigation_bar/installation_with_parameters_173-en.webp)

# Settings

The settings are called up via the [Navigation bar](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md). The following options are
available:

#### Language

You can select German or English here by simply clicking on them. The change is made immediately and
does not require you to restart the browser.

#### Extras

Seal management

Here you have the possibility to manage templates for seals.

Tag management

The tag management allows you to manage the tags.

Image management

With the image management, you can manage your icons and logos easily and quickly.

![image management](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/navigation_bar/settings/installation_with_parameters_179-en.webp)

#### Adding icons and logos

By clicking on the **New** button, the input mask will open.

![new image](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/navigation_bar/settings/installation_with_parameters_180-en.webp)

After filling in and uploading the icon/logo, the process only needs to be saved.

![save new image](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/navigation_bar/settings/installation_with_parameters_181-en.webp)

Edit / Delete icons and logos

If an icon and/or logo is outdated, you can edit or even delete the stored icons/logos.

![manage image](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/navigation_bar/settings/installation_with_parameters_182-en.webp)

#### Settings

The following options can be managed via this menu item:

- Global user rights
- Global settings
- User settings

The management of these settings is based on the client. Further information can be found under
global [User rights](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/administration/user-management/user-rights.md) and
[User settings](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/administration/user-management/user-settings.md)

The following settings are not available on the Web Application:

- Customizable window caption
- Permitted document extensions
- Clipboard gallery
- Category: Proxy

Account

Here it is possible to change the password of the logged in user.

# User menu

The user menu can be found in the upper right corner of the Web Application. A right click on the
logged in user opens it.

#### Options in the user menu

![bin_1](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/navigation_bar/user_menu/bin_1.webp)

Settings

All possible settings can be viewed in the following chapter settings.

Bin

In the bin you can manage your deleted passwords.

Help

A click on help takes you directly to the Netwrix Password Secure documentation page.

Switch to Basic view

What the Basic view is able to do in the web view can be inspected here.

Lock

This locks the user who is currently logged in and only needs to enter his password to use the web
client again.

Log out

The logged in user is logged out. All relevant information is now required to log on again.

# Operation

Operation of the Web Application has been based as far as possible on the operation of the Netwrix
Password Secure client. Nevertheless, there are some differences that need to be noted and they are
described here.

NOTE: There is also a Basic view in the Web Application. Everything worth knowing can be found at
the following link: web view Basic view

#### Login

There is no database profile on the Web Application. All databases approved for the Web Application
will be made available. The following information needs to be entered to log in:

Database name

User name

Password

![Login WebClient](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/installation_with_parameters_167-en.webp)

After successfully logging in, the last database name used and the last registered user will be
saved. You thus only need to enter the password for the next login.

#### Transferring login data via the URL

The **database name** and **user name** can be transferred directly via the URL. The following
parameters are used here:

- **database** for transferring the database nam
- **username** for transferring the user name

The parameters are simply attached to the URL for the Web Application and separated from one another
with a **&**.

Example

You want to call up the Web Application under **https://psr_Web Application.firma.com.** In the
process, you want the login mask to be directly filled with the database **Passwords** and the user
name **Anderson**. The following URL is then used: **https://psr_Web
Application.firma.com/authentication/ login?database=Passwords&username=Anderson**

NOTE: It is possible to only transfer the database. The user name is not absolutely necessary.

#### Structure

The Web Application is split into a number of sections that are described below.

![Operation](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/installation_with_parameters_168-en.webp)

1. [Header](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md)

The header provides access to some essential functions.

2. [Navigation bar](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md)

It is possible to switch between module and filter view on the navigation bar.

3. [Filter or structure area](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md)

As is also the case on the client, it is possible to select between filter and structure.

4. [Menu](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md)

The ribbon on the client has been replaced by a menu bar on the Web Application.

5. [List view](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md)

The records currently selected using the filter can be viewed in list view.

6. [Reading pane](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md)

The reading pane shows you details about the relevantly selected element.

7. [Footer](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/web-application/web-navigation.md)

Various information about the record is displayed in the footer. For example, logbook entries or the
history.

# Reading pane

## What is the reading pane?

As with the list view, the reading pane on the Web Application is almost identical to that on the
client. Therefore, we also refer you here to the corresponding
[Reading pane](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/user-interfaces/advanced-view/reading-pane.md) section.

![reading_pane](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/reading_pane/reading_pane.webp)

Various information is displayed on the header – as is the case with the client. For example, the
tags for the records or information on whether the record is public or private. Password masking is
also symbolised here.

NOTE: There are – as is usual in a browser – no context menus
