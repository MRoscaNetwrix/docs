# Client Module

## What are modules?

Netwrix Password Secure can be customized according to the needs of the users. This requirement can
be applied by the user, and can also be applied by administrative users. This means that everyone
gets only those functionalities that are necessary for his special work. The amount of features
required by an administrator differs significantly from those of a normal user. The **modular
structure** of Netwrix Password Secure supports this approach by showing only those specific areas
that should actually be used by the respective user.

## Visibility of modules

The modules are the gateway to various features of version 9. Similarly to the features, not all
modules have to be made available to all user layers. The **Visibility of modules** can be defined
individually within the user rights.

![user settings](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/client_modules_2-en.webp)

NOTE: The visibility of modules can always be adapted to the needs of individual user groups

## Sorting modules

You can access the “Navigation options” via the three dots found at the bottom right end of the
module displayed in the client. You can also find those modules displayed there that you have
permissions to see in accordance with the visibility settings explained previously but which are
hidden e.g. due to the scaling of the size of the client (Application and Password Reset in the
example).

![sorting modules](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/client_modules_3-en.webp)

The navigation options enable you to define the maximum number of visible elements and also how they
are sorted.

![sorting modules](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/client_modules_4-en.webp)

NOTE: The previously described visibility of the modules is a basic requirement for viewing and
sorting them in the navigation options

# Operation and Setup

## Client structure

The modular structure of the client ensure that the required functionalities are always in the same
place. Although the module selection gives access to the various areas of Netwrix Password Secure,
the control elements always remain at the positions specified for this purpose. This intuitive
operating concept ensures efficient work and a minimum of training time.

## TABs

Tabs offer yet another option within the to present related information in a separate area. This tab
navigation enables you to display, quickly access and switch between relevant information. The
results for a filter with specific criteria can thus be retained without the original result being
overwritten

when a new filter is applied. In parallel, detailed information about records can also be found in
their own tabs. It is of course possible to adjust the order of the tabs via drag & drop according
to your individual requirements.

![Dashboard](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/installation_with_parameters_2-en.webp)

#### Standard tab

Depending on the active module, the All passwords tab will be renamed to the corresponding module by
default. (All documents, all forms, etc.)

![Standard tab](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/standard-tab-en.webp)

Although the name suggests that all records in the database are displayed, the records displayed in
list view correspond to the criteria that have been defined in the filter. The tab closes and can be
restored by reusing the filter.

## Client footer information

Independently of the module chosen, various information is displayed in the footer area of the
client. The icons are also provided with a meaningful mouse-over text, which provides additional
information.

- Connection to database
- Feedback in case connection is insecure
- Last name, first name (user name) of the logged-in user

# Print

#### What can the print function do?

It is often necessary to print out data stored in Netwrix Password Secure for documentation
purposes. The Print function is available in numerous areas of Netwrix Password Secure for this
purpose. It is possible to print out records such as e.g. passwords or also information about
organisational units and much more.

#### Relevantrights

The following rights are relevant.

**Record rights**

- The **Print** right for the relevant record is required in each case.

User right

- Can print

#### Availability

The print function is available in the following modules:

- Passwords
- Documents
- Organisational structure
- Roles
- Forms

#### Using the print function

The print function can be called up via the ribbon.

![installation_with_parameters_44](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_44.webp)

Firstly, it is necessary to select whether you want to print a table or a detailed view. The amount
of data can also be defined. The individual menu items are described in detail further down in this
section. After making your selection, the data is firstly prepared for printing. Depending on the
amount of data, this may take a few minutes. The print preview is then opened.

![print password](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_45-en.webp)

NOTE: The print preview accesses the functions of the printer driver. Depending on the printer or
driver being used, the appearance and functions offered by the print preview may vary. The
individual functions will thus not be described in detail here.

The printing process is ultimately started via the **print preview**. It is also possible to save
the view or adjust the layout before printing.

#### Selecting the data to be printed

There are different options available for adapting the printing result to your personal
requirements. The individual menu items will be explained here using the example of printing
passwords.

###### Table view (current selection)

All **selected** records will be printed out. In the following example, **Adobe** and **Anibis.ch**
are thus printed out.

![selected data](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_46-en.webp)

The data is printed here in table form.

![print password](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_47-en.webp)

#### Tableview (current filter)

All currently **filtered** records will be printed out here. In this example, all seven records are
thus printed out.

![filtered password](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_48-en.webp)

They are printed out – as described above – in table form.

#### Detailed view (current selection)

This option also prints out the currently selected records. However, a detailed view is printed out
in this case.

![print filtered passwords](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/print/installation_with_parameters_49-en.webp)

#### Detailed view (current filter)

This function can be used to print out all filtered records in detailed view as described above.

NOTE: It should be noted that the amount of data generated via this function can quickly become very
large.
