# Keyboard shortcuts

## Functionality

Some actions can be executed very efficiently using keyboard shortcuts. These are configured in the
section of the same name within the **global
[User settings](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/administration/user-management/user-settings.md)**

The following keyboard shortcuts are available:

- **CTRL+ ALT + U** transfers the user name from the selected record to the active window
- **CTRL+ ALT + S** starts a script that firstly transfers the user name from the selected record to
  the active window. The shortcut will then execute a TAB jump and transfer the password.
- **CTRL+ ALT + P** enters the selected password into the active window or field
- **CTRL+ ALT + R** firstly transfers the user name from the selected record to the active window
  via the enter key. The shortcut will then execute a TAB jump and transfer the password.
