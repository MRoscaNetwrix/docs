# Reading pane

## What is the reading pane?

As with the list view, the reading pane on the Web Application is almost identical to that on the
client. Therefore, we also refer you here to the corresponding
[Reading pane](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/readingpane/reading_pane.md) section.

Various information is displayed on the header – as is the case with the client. For example, the
tags for the records or information on whether the record is public or private. Password masking is
also symbolised here.

NOTE: There are – as is usual in a browser – no context menus
