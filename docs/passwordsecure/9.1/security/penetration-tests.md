# Penetration tests

## External Penetration tests

The high security standards of Netwrix Password Secure are regularly attested by external pentests
of different providers. New functions in particular are always subjected to penetration tests in
order to have them thoroughly checked before release. The resulting findings enable us to detect and
eliminate potential vulnerabilities in advance.

## Why we test regularly?

In pentesting, external and certified security auditors look specifically for security gaps and
weaknesses in the software that an attacker could exploit. Attack scenarios are simulated on the
client side, the source code is checked and the quality of the cryptographic process is assessed. In
this way, the security of Netwrix Password Secure and the data stored in it is tested in advance in
order to be able to offer our customers effective protection and minimize the risk of success of an
attack.
