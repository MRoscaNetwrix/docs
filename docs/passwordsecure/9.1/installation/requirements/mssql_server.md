# MSSQL Server

#### Required Version

RECOMMENDED: Using MS SQL Server Express can lead to significant performance issues because of the
various limitations. Our recommendation is to use MS SQL Server Standard as a minimum.

Please follow Microsoft recommendations for system requirements for SQL Server.

#### Required Configuration

1. Service User: dbCreator (only required if the Netwrix Password Secure is used to create databases
   (recommended)), dbOwner  
   **a**. (Optional) Sysadmin (only when using the Netwrix Password Secure Backup Service)
