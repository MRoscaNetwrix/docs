# Yubico / Yubikey

## Setting up multifactor authentication

### Requirements

The following firewall release must be granted:

- [https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify](https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify)

### Requesting the Yubico API key

An API key must be requested for configuration. For this purpose, use the following link and enter
an e-mail address: [Yubico Website](https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/)

![yubico setup](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/multifactorauthentication/yubico/yubico_yubikey_1-en.webp)

Yubikey will then generate a **One Time Password**. The Yubikey used must only be touched in the
right place.

The **One Time Password** is entered directly into the corresponding field.

Once the general terms and conditions have been approved, the API Key can be requested.

### Configuring the Yubikey API

The actual setting up of the multifactor authentication is carried out on the Server Manager in the
**Database** module. First select the required data base; then open the "Features" in the ribbon.
The **Yubico Client ID** and the **Yubico Secret Key** must then be entered and saved.

![Configuration yubico](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/multifactorauthentication/yubico/yubico_yubikey_5-en.webp)

The interface is now ready and can be used.

NOTE: The HTTPS endpoint [Yubico Verify](https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify) is used for
communication with Yubico. Please make sure that the Netwrix Password Secure Server can connect to
this endpoint.

## Configuring multifactor authentication for users

Multifactor authentication can be configured in the Netwrix Password Secure client. It can be done
by the user themselves in **Backstage** in the
[Account](/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/account/account.md)
menu. In order to configure the Yubikey, simply select **Yubico OTP**.

Now click in the field for the token and create a token using the Yubikey. For **Yubikey NEO**, you
only need to touch the touch panel. The same applies to **Yubikey Nano**.

![yubico stick](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/multifactorauthentication/yubico/yubico_yubikey_2-en.webp)

The token is entered directly into the corresponding field. The multifactor authentication is
configured once youâ€™ve clicked on configure.

## Logging in with the Yubikey

To login with Multifactor Authentication, the database is first selected and then **User Name** and
**Password** are entered and confirmed.

After the first password authentication, another window for the **Yubico Key** is displayed.

![Login yubico](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/multifactorauthentication/yubico/yubico_yubikey_10-en.webp)

Click on the field to highlight it, and enter the **Yubico Key** by touching the Yubikeys.

![yubico stick](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/multifactorauthentication/yubico/yubico_yubikey_2-en.webp)

The user is now logged on.
