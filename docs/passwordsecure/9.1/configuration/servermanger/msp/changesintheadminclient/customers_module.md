# Customers module

#### Creating a new customer

Creating a new customer is done via the Customers module (1). Here, click on New (2) in the upper
left corner. This applies both to customers in a test phase and to customers who are to be billed
immediately.

![create-new-customer-msp-en_1035x753](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/customers_module/create-new-customer-msp-en_1035x753.webp)

When creating a new customer, the customer name is specified under **General** (1).

If (2) is not checked, a test customer is created without billing. This is then a customer in the
test phase. If (2) is checked, a customer will be created who will be charged by Netwrix from the
current month.

At (3) a date is automatically entered that is four weeks in the future. This date can be changed by
the managed service provider for test customers as well as billed customers, for example to limit
the test period or if the date of a possible termination of a billed customer should be known in
advance.

Under License (4) the maximum number of users can be specified. Here you have the possibility

(5) to limit the number up to which new users can be created or not. The options booked by the
customer (6) can be activated or deactivated by ticking them off. All other settings are identical
to the on-prem version.

After saving, the test customers are displayed under Test (1) and the customers to be billed under
Billed (2). When you click on a (test) customer, you will see the associated

information and activated options. By clicking the button Edit (3 + 4) you can make

adjustments can be made. The contract data can be adjusted by Edit (3).

The options can be activated or deactivated by Edit (4).

#### Test customer view

In the view of a test customer, the general contract data can be edited under the general contract
information under Edit (1) and the test customer can be converted to a billed customer. Billing
customers can no longer be converted back to test customers.

Under Active options, options can be selected and deselected with Edit (2). For test customers, no
billing data is available in the Forecast, Last Months and Cost History fields.

Since no costs are incurred for test customers, no information is displayed here under User history
(3), Forecast, Last months and Cost history.

#### Billed customer view

Here you can also edit the contract details and activate or deactivate options. Additionally you can
see the user history (4) of the last months, the forecast for the current month (5) including the
expected costs for the users and options, as well as the total amount. Furthermore, you will find
the statements of the last months (6) and a graphical representation of the cost history (7).

#### Deactivating and reactivating a customer

Both test customers and customers to be billed can be deactivated, e.g. if a test customer cannot
continue testing until later or if a customer to be billed does not pay his invoice. When
deactivating, all data is retained and the customer can be completely restored.

To deactivate a customer, select the database (1) and then Deactivate (2).

![deactivate-customer-msp](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/customers_module/deactivate-customer-msp.webp)

A reason (3) can be specified for the deactivation and then the database can be deactivated (4).

![deactivate-customer-2-msp](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/customers_module/deactivate-customer-2-msp.webp)

To reactivate a deactivated customer, select the deactivated database (1) and then Activate (2).

![reactivate-customer-msp-en](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/customers_module/reactivate-customer-msp-en.webp)

#### Deleting a customer

To delete a customer, select the database (1) and then Remove (2). Removal is possible with both
active and deactivated customer databases.

![remove-customer-msp-en_947x686](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/customers_module/remove-customer-msp-en_947x686.webp)

Deletion must be confirmed (3).

![confirm-delete-customer-msp-en](/img/product_docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/msp/changes_in_ac/customers_module/confirm-delete-customer-msp-en.webp)

The following dialog box (4) indicates that the database has been deleted in Netwrix Password
Secure, but you as an MSP are responsible for deleting the database in the SQL server as well as any
existing backups.
