# Right templates

## Using right templates

Once they have been configured, permissions can be constantly reused. The functionality **Saving
permissions as a template** in the ribbon is used for this purpose. The templates are globally
available and can also be used for other records.

NOTE: When saving templates, always select a name that will also allow it to be safely
differentiated from other templates if you have a large number of right templates.

Nevertheless, the use of right templates merely reduces the amount of work and still envisages the
manual setting of permissions. Automatic process for the issuing of permissions also exist in
Netwrix Password Secure and will be covered in the section
[Predefining rights](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/permissions/predefining-rights.md)
and also under
"[Inheritance from organisational structures](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/permissions/inheritance.md)".
