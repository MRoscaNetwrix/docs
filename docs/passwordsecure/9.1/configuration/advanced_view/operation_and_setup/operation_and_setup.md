# Operation and Setup

## Client structure

The modular structure of the client ensure that the required functionalities are always in the same
place. Although the module selection gives access to the various areas of Netwrix Password Secure,
the control elements always remain at the positions specified for this purpose. This intuitive
operating concept ensures efficient work and a minimum of training time.

## TABs

Tabs offer yet another option within the to present related information in a separate area. This tab
navigation enables you to display, quickly access and switch between relevant information. The
results for a filter with specific criteria can thus be retained without the original result being
overwritten

when a new filter is applied. In parallel, detailed information about records can also be found in
their own tabs. It is of course possible to adjust the order of the tabs via drag & drop according
to your individual requirements.

#### Standard tab

Depending on the active module, the All passwords tab will be renamed to the corresponding module by
default. (All documents, all forms, etc.)

Although the name suggests that all records in the database are displayed, the records displayed in
list view correspond to the criteria that have been defined in the filter. The tab closes and can be
restored by reusing the filter.

## Client footer information

Independently of the module chosen, various information is displayed in the footer area of the
client. The icons are also provided with a meaningful mouse-over text, which provides additional
information.

- Connection to database
- Feedback in case connection is insecure
- Last name, first name (user name) of the logged-in user
