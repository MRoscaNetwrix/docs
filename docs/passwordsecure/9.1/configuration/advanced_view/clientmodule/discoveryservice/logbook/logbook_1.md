# Logbook

The logbook in the footer of the **Discovery Service Task** is extremely helpful for checking the
**Discovery Service Task**. Information about the progress of the **Discovery Service Task** is
displayed here. The data is displayed both in the **footer** and also in the **logbook module**
(although in more detail here). To display the footer, the user requires the **user right**: Global
settings in the
[User settings](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/user_settings/user_settings.md)
in the category: "Footer area" - "Show logbook in the footer area (activated)"

## Show in footer

The following **events** are displayed in the **logbook for the footer** and in the **logbook
module**:

1. New
2. Change
3. Execute
4. Execution completed
5. Error during execution

If an error occurs during the execution of the **Discovery Service Task**, this is also shown n the
**logbook for the footer** with **additional information** about the error.

## Display in the logbook

In general, the **logbook module** displays more detailed information about the **Discovery Service
Task**. The
[Filter](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/filter/filter.md)
can be used to select which data is displayed. The same **events** as for the footer for the
**Discovery Service Task** are also used here.

The column editor can be used to arrange and display the data in the table according to their
importance.
