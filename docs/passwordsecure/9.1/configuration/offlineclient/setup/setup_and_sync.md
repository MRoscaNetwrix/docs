# Setup and sync

## Setting up the offline database

It is important to ensure that the right requirements have been met before setting up the Offline
Add-on. The following configurations need to be defined in both the Server Manager and also the user
rights/user settings.

Requirements

To set up offline databases, this option must be activated in the Server Manager first. This process
is carried out separately for each database in the database view in the Server Manager in the
“General settings” (right click on the database). This is also possible to do when the database is
initially created.

You will find further information on this subject in the
sections:[ Creating databases](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/creatingdatabase/creating_databases.md)
and
[Managing databases](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server_manager/managing_databases/managing_databases.md)

User rights

The user requires the “offline mode” right. In addition, how long offline mode can be used without a
server connection can be defined in the user rights.

Creating an offline database

The synchronization with the offline database can generally be carried out automatically. However,
**the first synchronization must be carried out manually**. The synchronization is started via the
Main menu/Account.

NOTE: The offline databases are stored locally under the following path: %appdata%\MATESO\Password
Safe and Repository Client\OfflineDB

An offline database must be created per user and client for each online database. This makes it
possible to use several offline databases with an Offline Add-on.

#### Synchronization

In order to keep the data always consistent, the offline database must be synchronized regularly.
Synchronization is automatically performed by the client in the background. The interval can be
freely configured in the
[User settings](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/user_settings/user_settings.md).
The synchronization is completed every 30 minutes by default. When creating and editing records, it
is also possible to synchronize outside of the synchronization cycle so that the changes are
directly available offline. In addition, the synchronization can also be started manually in
Backstage via “Account”.

A running synchronization is displayed in the icon in the task bar as well as by a status bar in the
client:

As soon as the synchronization is completed, this is indicated by a hint.

#### Relevant settings

Offline mode can be configured and personalized using the four settings mentioned:

- **Offline synchronization after saving a record**: The synchronization of the offline database is
  completed directly after saving a record. It is important to note that this only applies to those
  records that are saved by the user who is logged in. Changes made by another user do not trigger
  any synchronization!
- **Offline synchronization after login:** If this option is active, the offline database is
  synchronized after each restart of the client.
- **Automatic synchronization after an interval**: This setting is used to define the interval at
  which a synchronization of the offline database will be periodically carried out. The default
  value is 30 minutes.
- **Path where the offline database should be saved**: If this field is left empty, the system
  default is used. Otherwise, the storage location for the offline database can be entered directly.
