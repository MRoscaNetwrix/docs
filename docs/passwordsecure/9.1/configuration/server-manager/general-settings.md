# General settings

## What are general settings?

The **general settings** relate to users. Thus, each user can customize the software to their own
needs. The following options can be configured:

Colour scheme

Various Windows colour schemes are available. The colour scheme Colorful provides e.g. different
colours which make it easier to distinguish between the modules in the software. If the colour
scheme is changed, the client must be restarted.

Language

The user can toggle between English and German. After changing the language, the client must be
restarted.

Starting the application minimised in the notification area

You can start the client minimized if you wish to run Netwrix Password Secure in the background. You
will be able to access it through the notification area.

Minimise the application on closing

If this option has been activated, the Netwrix Password Secure client will not end when the window
is closed but will merely be minimised. It will continue to run in the background. It is then only
possible to properly end Netwrix Password Secure via the main menu.

Starting with Windows

Of course, you can start the Netwrix Password Secure Client directly with Windows.
