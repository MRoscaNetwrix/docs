# Problems with the server connection

If no connection can be established from the Web Application, there are several possible causes:

Server not started

First, you should check whether the application server is running.

Service not started

The Windows service administration should be used to check whether the **Netwrix Password Secure
Service** has been started.

Port not released

Port 11016 TCP must be released on the application server.

CORS not configured

Make sure that the CORS configuration has been implemented. Further information can be found in
chapter Installation Web Application
