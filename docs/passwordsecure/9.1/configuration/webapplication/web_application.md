# Web Application

## What is the Web Application

The previous WebAccess function has been replaced by the **Web Application‚Äù in Netwrix Password
Secure version** **8.3.0. The completely newly developed \*Web Application** will act as the basis
for the constant enhancement of the functional scope. The desired objective is to also provide the
full functional scope of the client in the Web Application. The **Web Application** will thus be
constantly enhanced. All of the currently available functions can be viewed in the
[Functional scope](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/webapplication/functionalscope/functional_scope.md)
section.

**Netwrix Password Secure Web Application** enables platform-independent access to the database via
a browser. It is irrelevant whether you are using Microsoft Windows, macOS or Linux, it is only
necessary for javascript to be supported. As the **Netwrix Password Secure Web Application** has a
responsive design, it can also be used on all mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.

The **Web Application** is based both optically and also in its operation on the Netwrix Password
Secure client. As usual, users can only access the data for which they also have permissions. The
installation is described in the section
[Installation Web Application](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/installation/installationwebapplication/installation_web_application.md)
