# Masterkey mode

## Maximum convenience

In contrast to
[End-to-end encryption](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/authentication/directory-services/end-to-end-encryption.md),
which places the main focus on security, Masterkey mode provides the maximum level of convenience.
It not only imports users, organisational units and roles but also their links and affiliations. It
can be synchronized to update the information and affiliations. **In this scenario, Active Directory
is used as a leading system**.

## Relevant rights

The following options are required to add new profiles.

### User right

- Can add new Active Directory profiles
- Display organisational structure module
- Display role module

## Creating profiles

Profile management is started via the icon of the same name on the ribbon.

![AD profile](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/masterkey_mode_1-en.webp)

The following information must be provided in the profile:

- **Profile name**
- An optional **description**
- Masterkey mode is selected for the **encryption**

NOTE: In the case of already created profiles, the encryption can no longer be changed.

- The **domain** field is used to define which domain is to be read. The value entered here will
  also be used for authentication if no alternative spellings have been saved under **Other domain
  names**.
- A **local user** (for example, the administrator) or an already imported user must be specified.
  The data will be imported under that user’s name.
- A **user** is required to access the AD. The user should be formatted as follows: Domain\User. It
  must have access to the AD.
- Corresponding **user password** (domain password) for the user.
- \*_Direct search_ is recommended for very large domain trees. The tree structure is omitted,
  elements can then only be found and selected via the search.
- By activating the checkbox **Restrict user import to role members only**, a simplified mode is
  activated. In this mode, only AD users who are members of at least one role are imported. As soon
  as they are no longer a member of at least one role, they are deleted from Netwrix Password
  Secure.
- By activating the checkbox **Force update on next synchronization**, **ALL** records will be
  updated on the next synchronization, regardless of whether the record has changed in the Active
  Directory or not. (This checkbox is automatically activated when you have edited the other
  responsible users and is deactivated again after the next synchronization).
- The **LDAP filter** can be used to directly specify an AD path as an entry point via an LDAP
  query.
- Various security options – so-called AuthenticationTypes Enumeration (**Flags**) – can be selected
  for the connection of the AD to Netwrix Password Secure:
  - Secure
  - SecureSocketsLayer
  - ReadOnlyServer
  - Signing
  - Sealing

NOTE: The first two options are already activated by default when configuring a new profile. If a
connection is not possible, deactivate SecureSocketsLayer and try again.

- **Other responsible users or roles** can be used to define who is permitted to carry out the
  synchronization with the AD.
- The option **Other domain names** can be used to save alternative spellings of the login domain.
  These must correspond to the spelling entered in the login window. For example, if a connection is
  being established to the domain **jupiter.local** or an IP address, the login can only be carried
  out with **jupiter\user** if **jupiter** has been saved here.

**CAUTION:** The master key is added in form of a certificate. It is **essential to back up** the
generated certificate! If the database is being moved to another server, the certificate also needs
to be transferred! Further information can be found in the section
[Certificates](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/server-manager/certificates.md).

NOTE: You can now use the option to integrate a RADIUS server. Read more in
[RADIUS authentication](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/authentication/directory-services/radius-authentication.md).

## Import

You can start the import directly in the ribbon. A wizard guides the user through the entire
operation.

![import icon](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/end_to_end_encryption_2-en.webp)

## Organisational structure

First, an organisational unit is selected for the import. If there are no organisational units in
the database yet, as in this example, the data is imported into the **main organisational unit**.

![import wizard / organisational structure](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/end_to_end_encryption_3-en.webp)

### Active Directory objects

In the next step, select the profile you will use to import the data. Then, select organisational
units and/or users for the import. A search is available for this purpose.

![import wizard / AD objects](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/end_to_end_encryption_4-en.webp)

As you can see, the organisational units **Jupiter** and **Contoso** contain items to be imported.
The organisational units themselves will not be imported. The group **1099 Contractor** is imported
including all sub-elements. The check next to the group **Accounting** indicates that the group
itself will be imported along with some of its sub-elements. The ticks in the last column ensure
that the elements are observed in future synchronization sequences.

There are different symbols which indicate the elements to be imported.

The element itself and all possible sub-elements will be imported The element itself and some of its
sub-elements will be imported The element will not be imported; however, it contains elements that
will be imported

Right-clicking in the list will launch a context menu. It provides helpful functions for the
selection of the individual elements.

![select subjects](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/end_to_end_encryption_5-en.webp)

NOTE: If individual users cannot be selected for import, they have already been imported via an
end-to-end encrypted profile.

In the lower area you can specify whether the users just selected for import should be created as
**Light** or **Advanced User (View)**s.

## Summary

The last page summarizes which objects will be edited and in what form. It specifies the names of
the elements along with their descriptions. The **Status** column specifies whether the object is
added, updated, or disabled. The last column specifies the organisational unit into which the
element is imported. The number of objects can be seen at the bottom.

![import wizard / summary](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/end_to_end_encryption_6-en.webp)

## Importing

The server imports data in the background. The individual elements then appear in the list one by
one. This may take some time, depending on the amount of import data. If the import was terminated,
this is symbolized by a hint.

![Notification](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/end_to_end_encryption_7-en.webp)

## Imported users and organisational units

The users and organisational units imported in Masterkey mode cannot be edited in Netwrix Password
Secure. Therefore, any changes must be made in AD and synchronized. AD thus becomes the leading
system. Affiliations to roles are also synchronized and must be set in the AD. In organisational
units or roles created in Netwrix Password Secure, the users can be included directly in Netwrix
Password Secure.

## Rights

The rights will be issued as follows during the import or synchronization.

### New objects

|                                   | User                                              | Groups                      | Roles                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Are rights inherited from the OU? | If no preset has been saved                       | If no preset has been saved | No                             |
| Are rights applied from a preset? | If a preset has been saved                        | If a preset has been saved  | No                             |
| Is the "add" right issued?        | No                                                | Yes                         | No                             |
| Who receives the rights key?      | Imported users and all with the "authorize" right | All                         | All with the "authorize" right |

### Changed objects

|                                   | User                           | Groups | Roles                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Are rights inherited from the OU? | If no preset has been saved    | No     | No                             |
| Are rights applied from a preset? | If a preset has been saved     | No     | No                             |
| Is the "add" right issued?        | No                             | No     | No                             |
| Who receives the rights key?      | All with the "authorize" right | None   | All with the "authorize" right |

NOTE: If a user is imported, he will be given those roles that he also had in AD insofar as these
roles already exist in Netwrix Password Secure or have also been imported.

## Logging into Netwrix Password Secure

Users who are imported using this mode can log in with the domain password. Please note that no
domain needs to be specified when logging in. Of course, the login process can also be supplemented
with
[Multifactor Authentication](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/configuration/authentication/multifactor-authentication/multifactor-overview.md).

NOTE: Logging on using Kerberos works "automatically". As long as the corresponding Kerberos server
is accessible, the users in the domain authenticate themselves via Kerberos using their domain
password. If the logon via Kerberos does not work – e.g. due to incorrect configuration of the
domain controller – the logon via the NTLM protocol is attempted. However, these are all settings
that have to be made on the domain controller and have nothing to do with Netwrix Password Secure.

**CAUTION:** Logging on to Netwrix Password Secure using SSO via Kerberos is currently not possible.

## Permissions to imported objects

The rights to be issued to imported users are explained in the following example:

![Permission MKM User](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/masterkey_mode_7-en.webp)

1. In Master Key mode, **all** users will be issued with the **read** right.
2. The **responsible user** will be issued with all rights and the key. This ensures that he can
   also synchronize or change the user in the future
3. **Other responsible users** are issued with the same rights as the **responsible user**
4. The **Master Key** for the **Active Directory** profile will also be issued with all rights and
   keys as it will be used for the synchronization
5. Finally, users will be issued with the rights for themselves

NOTE: All users and roles issued with **rights** to the imported object also receive its rights key.

## Synchronization

During synchronization, all relevant information for users, organisational units and roles (names,
email, etc.) is updated. Changed affiliations for roles are adjusted. Likewise, users are activated
or deactivated according to the settings in the AD. If the membership of organisational units is to
be changed, this can be done by **Drag & Drop**. New users and correspondingly defined roles are
imported.

NOTE: If the tick was not set in the Synchronization column when a user is imported, no changes are
made.

### Manual synchronization

The synchronization can be started manually at any time via the corresponding button in the ribbon.

![manual synchronization](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/organisationalstructures/directoryservices/activedirectorylink/masterkey_mode_8-en.webp)

Select the required profile and start the synchronization. As is the case with the initial import,
the synchronization runs in the background. A hint indicates that the process has been completed.

### Synchronization via system tasks

The synchronization can also be carried out automatically. This is made possible via the
[System tasks](/docs/passwordsecure/9.1/user-guides/administration/extras/system-tasks.md).

### Deleting or removing users

If a user is deleted in Active Directory, it is also deleted in Netwrix Password Secure during the
next synchronization. For this purpose, it is necessary for the user to be imported as a
**synchronizable** user.

If the user is only deleted from Netwrix Password Secure but retained in Active Directory, a
synchronization needs to be carried out to delete it from the database. For this purpose, the wizard
is called up via **import**. The first step is to select an organisational unit. This has no effect
when simply deleting a user. The second step is to search for the user. Both ticks are removed.

After checking the summary, the process is concluded. The synchronization is completed and the user
is deleted from the database.
