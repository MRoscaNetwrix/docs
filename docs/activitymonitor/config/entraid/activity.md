# Microsoft Entra ID Activity Auditing Configuration

It is necessary to register Activity Monitor as a web application to the targeted Microsoft Entra ID
(formerly Azure AD), in order for Activity Monitor to monitor the environment. This generates the
Client ID and Client Secret needed by the Activity Agent. See
[Microsoft Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-reporting-api-prerequisites-azure-portal)
for assistance in configuring the Microsoft Entra ID web application.

**NOTE:** A user account with the Global Administrator role is required to register an app with
Microsoft Entra ID.

Configuration Settings from the Registered Application

The following settings are needed from your tenant once you have registered the application:

- Tenant ID – This is the Tenant ID for Microsoft Entra ID
- Client ID – This is the Application (client) ID for the registered application
- Client Secret – This is the Client Secret Value generated when a new secret is created

    **CAUTION:** It is not possible to retrieve the value after saving the new key. It must be
    copied first.

## Permissions

The following permissions are required:

- Microsoft Graph API

    - Application Permissions:

        - AuditLog.Read.All – Read all audit log data
        - Directory.Read.All – Read directory data
