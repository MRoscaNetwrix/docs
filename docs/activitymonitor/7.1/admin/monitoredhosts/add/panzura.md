Understanding File Activity Monitoring

The Activity Monitor can be configured to monitor the following:

- Ability to collect all or specific file activity for specific values or specific combinations of
  values

It provides the ability to feed activity data to SIEM products. The following dashboards have been
specifically created for Activity Monitor event data:

- For IBM® QRadar®, see the
  [Netwrix File Activity Monitor App for QRadar](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/siem/qradar/overview.md)
  for additional information.
- For Splunk®, see the
  [File Activity Monitor App for Splunk](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/siem/splunk/overview.md)
  for additional information.

It also provides the ability to feed activity data to other Netwrix products:

- Netwrix Threat Prevention
- Netwrix Threat Manager

_Remember,_ the Activity Agent must be deployed to a Windows server that acts as a proxy for
monitoring the target environment.

## Add Panzura Host

Prior to adding a Panzura host to the Activity Monitor, the prerequisites for the target environment
must be met. See the
[Panzura CloudFS Monitoring](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/requirements/activityagent/nasdeviceconfiguration/activity_2.md) topic
for additional information.

Follow the steps to add a Panzura host to be monitored.

**Step 1 –** In Activity Monitor, go to the Monitored Hosts tab and click Add. The Add New Host
window opens.

![Choose Agent](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/chooseagent.webp)

**Step 2 –** On the Choose Agent page, select the **Agent** to monitor the storage device. Click
**Next**.

![Add Host](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/addhostpanzura.webp)

**Step 3 –** On the Add Host page, select the **Panzura** radio button and enter the **Panzura filer
name**. Click **Next**.

![Panzura Properties](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/panzuraoptions.webp)

**Step 4 –** On the Panzura Options page, enter the **Username**, **Password**, and select the
**Protocol** to be used by the Panzura host.

- The different protocols that can be selected are:

    - Auto Detect (Default)
    - HTTPS
    - HTTPS, ignore certificate errors

    Click **HTTPS Options** to open the Trusted server certificate window.

Click **Next**.

![Customize Certifiacte Verification](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/trustedservercertificate.webp)

- HTTPS Options – Opens the Trusted server certificate window to customize the certificate
  verification during a TLS session

    - Import – Click to browse for a trusted server certificate
    - Remove – Click to remove selected trusted server certificate
    - Enable hostname verification – Select this checkbox to ensure that the host name the product
      connects to matches the name in the certificate (CN name)
    - Click OK to close the window and save the modifications

    Click **Connect** to connect to the Panzura device. Click **Next**.

![Configure Operations](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/panzuraconfigureoperations.webp)

**Step 5 –** On the Configure Operations page, select the **File Operations** and **Directory
Operations** to be monitored.

- Suppress Microsoft Office operations on temporary files – Filters out events for Microsoft Office
  temporary files. When Microsoft Office files are saved or edited, many temporary files are
  created. With this option enabled, events for these temporary files are ignored.

Click **Next**.

![configurebasicoptionspanzura](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/configurebasicoptionspanzura.webp)

**Step 6 –** On the Configure Basic Options page, choose which of the following settings to enable:

- Add C:\ to the beginning of the reported file paths - Adds ‘C:\” to file paths to be displayed
  like a Windows file path:
    - Display example if checked – C:\Folder\file.txt
    - Display example if unchecked – /Folder/file.text
- Report UNC paths - Adds a UNC Path column and a Rename UNC Path column in the generated TSV files
    - This option corresponds to the REPORT_UNC_PATH parameter in the INI file. It is disabled by
      default. The UNC Path is in the following format:
        - For CIFS activity – \\[HOST]\[SHARE]\[PATH]
        - Example CIFS activity – \\ExampleHost\TestShare\DocTeam\Temp.txt
        - For NFS activity – [HOST]:/[VOLUME]/[PATH]
        - Example NFS activity – ExampleHost:/ExampleVolume/DocTeam/Temp.txt
    - When the option is enabled, the added columns are populated when a file is accessed remotely
      through the UNC Path. If a file is accessed locally, these columns are empty. These columns
      have also been added as Syslog macros.
- Report operations with millisecond precision - Changes the timestamps of events being recorded in
  the TSV log file for better ordering of events if multiple events occur within the same second.
    - Enterprise Auditor 8.1+ is required to use this feature.

Click **Next**.

![wheretologgeneric](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/wheretologgeneric.webp)

**Step 7 –** On the Where To Log The Activity page, select whether to send the activity to either a
**Log File)** or **Syslog Server**. Click **Next**.

**NOTE:** An option must be selected before moving to the next step.

![fileoutput](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/fileoutput.webp)

**Step 8 –** If **Log File)** is selected on the **Where To Log The Activity** page, the **File
Output** page can be configured.

- Specify output file path – Specify the file path where TSV log files are saved on the agent's
  server. Click the ellipses button (...) to open the Windows Explorer to navigate to a folder
  destination. Click **Test** to test if the path works.
- Period to keep Log files – Log files will be deleted after the period entered as the number of
  days elapses. The default is 10 days. Use the dropdown to specify whether to keep the Log files
  for a set amount of Minutes, Hours, or Days.
- This log file is for Enterprise Auditor – Enable this option to have Enterprise Auditor collect
  this monitored host configuration

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** Identify the configuration to be read by Enterprise Auditor when integration
    is available.

    - While Activity Monitor can have multiple configurations per host, Enterprise Auditor can only
      read one of them.

- Add header to Log files – Adds headers to TSV files. This is used to feed data into Splunk.

Click **Next**.

![syslogoutput](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/syslogoutput.webp)

**Step 9 –** If Syslog Server is selected on the **Where To Log The Activity** page, the Syslog
Output page can be configured.

- Syslog server in SERVER[:PORT] format – Type the **Syslog server name** with a SERVER:Port format
  in the textbox.
    - The server name can be short name, fully qualified name (FQDN), or IP Address, as long as the
      organization’s environment can resolve the name format used. The Event stream is the activity
      being monitored according to this configuration for the monitored host.
- Syslog Protocol – Identify the **Syslog protocol** to be used for the Event stream. The drop-down
  menu includes:

    - UDP
    - TCP
    - TLS

    The TCP and TLS protocols add the **Message framing** drop-down menu. See the
    [Syslog Tab](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/outputs/syslog/syslog.md) topic
    for additional information.

- The Test button sends a test message to the Syslog server to check the connection. A green check
  mark or red will determine whether the test message has been sent or failed to send. Messages vary
  by Syslog protocol:

    - UDP – Sends a test message and does not verify connection
    - TCP/TLS – Sends test message and verifies connection
    - TLS – Shows error if TLS handshake fails

    See the
    [Syslog Tab](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/outputs/syslog/syslog.md) topic
    for additional information.

Click **Finish**.

![activitymonitorpanzura](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/add/activitymonitorpanzura.webp)

The added Panzura host is displayed in the monitored hosts table. Once a host has been added for
monitoring, configure the desired ouptuts. See the
[Output for Monitored Hosts](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/monitoredhosts/output/output.md)
topic for additional information.
