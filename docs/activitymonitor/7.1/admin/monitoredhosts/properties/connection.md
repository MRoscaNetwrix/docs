# Connection Tab

Once a host is added to the monitored hosts table, the configuration settings are edited through the
tabs in the host’s Properties window. The Connection tab on a host’s Properties window is specific
to Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online hosts.
