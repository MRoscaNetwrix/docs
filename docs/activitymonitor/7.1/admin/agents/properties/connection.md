# Connection Tab

The Connection tab allows users to modify the agent host server name and the credentials used for
installation and communication. The tab varies based on the type of agent selected.

## For Activity Agent

The server name can be modified in the text box. Modifying the name value does not move the activity
agent to a new server. The credentials can be updated or modified as well.

_Remember,_ **Test** the credentials before clicking OK to ensure a successful connection.

Agent server fields:

- Server name – Name or IP address of the server where the agent is deploy
- Port – Port the agent uses for communication with the application

Credential fields:

- User name – Account provisioned for use by the agent
- Password – Password for the supplied User name

Permissions

This account must be:

- Membership in the local Administrators group

If the user name is not specified, the currently logged in user's account will be used.

Less Privileged Permissions Option

By default, the agent accepts commands only from members of the local Administrators group. You can
allow less privileged accounts to manage the agent with the **Management Group** option. Keep in
mind that you still need to be an administrator to install, upgrade, or uninstall the agent. The
Management Group applies to the users of the console and API servers. The Management Group does not
restrict access to the agents, but grants access to its members in addition to existing members of
the local Administrators group.

The Specify account or group window is opened from a field where a Windows account is needed.
