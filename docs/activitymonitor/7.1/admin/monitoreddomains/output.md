# Output for Monitored Domains

Once a domain is being monitored the event stream can be sent to multiple outputs.

Configured outputs are grouped under the domain. You can have multiple outputs configured for a
domain. The domain event outputs are:

- File – Creates an activity log as a JSON file for every day of activity

    **NOTE:** This is required to search event data for Active Directory within the application.

- Syslog – Sends activity events to the configured SIEM server
- Netwrix Threat Manager (StealthDEFEND) – Sends activity events to Netwrix Threat Manager or
  receives Active Directory monitoring events from Netwrix Threat Prevention for integration with
  Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
