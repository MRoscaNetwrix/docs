# Microsoft Entra ID Search Query

You can search activity in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) that has been monitored and recorded to a
File output. When you select **Azure AD / Entra ID** from the magnifying glass drop-down menu, a New
Search tab opens with the applicable query filters.

The filters are separated into the following categories:

- General
- User
- Audit Events
- Target Resource
- Sign-in Events
- Location

By default, the query is set to return all event activity for the past day. Configuring query
filters will scope results returned.

Set the filters as desired and click **Search**. The application searches through the appropriate
activity log files and returns the events that match the filters. You can
[Filter](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#filter) and
[Sort](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#sort) the
results using the column headers. Below the Search button is the
[Export](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#export)
option.

**Filter Value Entry**

When the drop-down menu is in front of a query filter, it is used to show or hide the filter entry
field. Field options vary based on the selected query filter:

- Textbox – Enter the filter value. If the field has a drop-down arrow, then you can select from
  values known to the application.
- Gray drop-down menu – Provides options to match the value against on of the following, which vary
  based on the filter:

    - Selected values – Filters by the value selected from the drop-down menu for the textbox
    - Simple string with wildcards – Filters by the value entered into the textbox, which contains
      an asterisk (\*) as the wildcard
    - Regular expression – Filters by the Regex entered into the textbox
