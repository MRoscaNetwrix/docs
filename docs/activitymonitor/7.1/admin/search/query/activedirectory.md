# Active Directory Search Query

You can search domain activity that has been monitored and recorded to a File output. When you
select **Active Directory** from the magnifying glass drop-down menu, a New Search tab opens with
the applicable query filters.

![Search - Active Directory New Search Tab](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/activitymonitor/admin/search/query/activedirectorynewsearchtab.webp)

The filters are separated into the following categories:

- General
- Object Changes
- LSASS Guardian
- LDAP Queries
- Authentication

By default, the query is set to return all event activity for the past day. Configuring query
filters will scope results returned.

Set the filters as desired and click **Search**. The application searches through the appropriate
activity log files and returns the events that match the filters. You can
[Filter](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#filter) and
[Sort](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#sort) the
results using the column headers. Below the Search button is the
[Export](/docs/activitymonitor/7.1/admin/search/overview.md#export)
option.

Filter Value Entry

When the drop-down menu is in front of a query filter, it is used to show or hide the filter entry
field. Field options vary based on the selected query filter:

- Textbox – Enter the filter value. If the field has a drop-down arrow, then you can select from
  values known to the application.
- Gray drop-down menu – Provides options to match the value against on of the following, which vary
  based on the filter:

    - Selected values – Filters by the value selected from the drop-down menu for the textbox
    - Simple string with wildcards – Filters by the value entered into the textbox, which contains
      an asterisk (\*) as the wildcard
    - Regular expression – Filters by the Regex entered into the textbox

## General Category

The General category addresses who, what, where, and when an object, user, host, or domain
controller is affected by the events selected in the other categories. The time frame filter must be
