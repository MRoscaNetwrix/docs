# Performance Monitoring

This topic provides a list of Activity Monitor performance counters and standard system-wide
performance counters (Memory and CPU usage, TCP disconnections, etc) that are recommended for
Activity Monitor performance monitoring. These performance counters can help diagnose performance
issues.

## Performance Counters

The following performance counters are provided by Activity Monitor.

This counter may increase from time to time when processing large batches of events. But if it keeps increasing, it is a sure sign that the agent is not coping with the load. Consider moving some SVMs to another agent or spreading the load from one SVM across multiple agents. |

**NOTE:** DNS and AD queries typically contribute the most to the processing time. Since the
resolution occurs in real time, slow responses can affect throughput (A 100ms DNS response limits
the throughput to 10 events per second). Observing average and maximum values of DNS Queries Time,
Resolved SIDs Time, and Translated UIDs Time allows you to estimate the response time.

## Recommended System Performance Counters

In addition to the Activity Monitor performance counters, it is recommended to use the following
performance counters:

## Register Performance Counters

The Activity Monitor performance counters are not registered by default and must be registered
manually.

Follow the steps to register the Activity Monitor performance counters on each SAM Agent server.

**Step 1 –** Run `cmd.exe` as Administrator.

**Step 2 –** Change current directory to the agent installation folder
(`C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent`).

cd "C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent"

**Step 3 –** Register the performance counters manifest file.

lodctr /M:PerfCounters.man

Expected output: Info: Successfully installed performance counters in
`C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent\PerfCounters.man`

**Step 4 –** Restart the services:

sc stop SBFileMonAgentSvc

sc stop FPolicyServerSvc

sc stop CelerraServerSvc

sc stop SBTLoggingSvc

sc start SBFileMonAgentSvc

## Collect Performance Data

The performance data can be observed or saved using any tool capable of collecting performance
counters. For example, Performance Monitor.

**NOTE:** The following script is only compatible with PowerShell 5.X and previous versions. Using
PowerShell 7.X requires Windows Performance Monitor to be configured to collect performance
counters.

Below is a PowerShell script that collects the counters every second and stores them in
`perfcounters_SERVERNAME_TIMESTAMP.csv` files. The expected file size per day is about 50MB.

Run the script on each agent server using the following command:

powershell -file AM.PerfCollect.ps1

To stop the script press **Ctrl+C**.

Script (save it to AM.PerfCollect.ps1):

```powershell
$sampleInterval = 1

$maxSamples = 0

$outputFile = "perfcounters_$($env:COMPUTERNAME)_$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss").csv"

$counters =

$variables = @{

SampleInterval = $sampleInterval

Counter = $counters

}

if ($maxSamples -eq 0) {

$variables.Add("Continuous", 1)}

else {

$variables.Add("MaxSamples", "$maxSamples")

}

Write-Host "Collecting performance counters to $outputFile... Press Ctrl+C to stop."

Get-Counter @variables | Export-Counter -FileFormat csv -Path $outputFile -Force
```

## Unregister Performance Counters

When performance monitoring is not needed anymore, unregister the Activity Monitor performance
counters.

Follow the steps to unregister the Activity Monitor performance counters on each SAM Agent server.

**Step 1 –** Run `cmd.exe` as Administrator.

**Step 2 –** Change current directory to the agent installation folder.

cd "C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent"

**Step 3 –** Unregister the performance counters manifest file.

unlodctr /M:PerfCounters.man

Expected output: Info: Successfully uninstalled the performance counters from the counter definition
XML file PerfCounters.man.

**Step 4 –** Restart the services:

sc stop SBFileMonAgentSvc

sc stop FPolicyServerSvc

sc stop CelerraServerSvc

sc stop SBTLoggingSvc

sc start SBFileMonAgentSvc

Once the services have been restarted, the Activity Monitor performance counters are unregistered.
