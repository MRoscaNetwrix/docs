# SIEM Integrations

Stealthbits File Activity monitoring solutions enable organizations to successfully, efficiently,
and affordably monitor file access and permission changes across Windows and Network Attached
Storage (NAS) file systems in real-time. Using preconfigured Stealthbits File Activity Monitor Apps,
users can quickly understand all file activities as a whole, for specific resources or users, as
well as patterns of activity indicative of threats such as crypto ransomware or data exfiltration
attempts. With full control over the data, users can create custom searches, all while enabling apps
to correlate file system activity with any log source.
