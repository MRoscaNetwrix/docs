# Monitored Domains Tab

Understanding Active Directory Activity Monitoring

The Activity Monitor can be configured to monitor the following Active Directory changes:

- Success and Failure on Object Create
- Success and Failure on Object Delete
- Success and Failure on Object Rename
- Success and Failure on Object Move
- Success and Failure on Logon
- LDAP Activity Monitoring

It also provides the ability to feed activity data to other Netwrix products:

- Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor)
- Netwrix Threat Manager

It also provides the ability to feed activity data to SIEM products.

Agents

For monitoring an Active Directory domain, the AD Agent must be installed on all domain controllers
within the domain to be monitored.

Tab

Once the AD Agent(s) installation is complete on a domain controller, the domain appear on the
Monitored Domains tab. The tab is not visible within the console until at least one AD Agent has
been deployed.

This tab is comprised of a button bar and a table of domains being monitored. The events stream
output needs to be designated to view data after an activity search has been performed.

## Button Bar

The button bar allows users to take the following actions:

  StealthDEFEND. See the [Output for Monitored Domains](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoreddomains/output/output.md)
- Remove – Removes the configured domain from the table of domains being monitored and end
  monitoring. Confirmation of this option will be asked for.

  the [AD Monitoring Configuration Window](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoreddomains/admonitoringconfiguration/overview.md) topic for

- Domain – Name or IP Address of the domain being monitored

    **NOTE:** The same domain can be monitored for different outputs. Each output is listed under
    the domain with destination information.

- Master – Name or IP Address of the domain controller where the AD agent is deployed
- Last Event – Date timestamp of the last event

## Monitoring Status

The Error Propagation collapsible section located above the Status Bar of the Activity Monitor
provides visibility into a domain's monitoring state. Domain monitoring status is depicted in the
Monitored Domains table under the Status column. Users can expand the Error Propagation section to
view more information on various status conditions.
