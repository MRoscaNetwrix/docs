The tab contains the following settings:

- Add – Opens the Add or Edit GID window to add a group for exclusion. See the
  [Add or Edit GID Window](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/outputs/gidexclusions/addeditgid.md) topic for additional information.
- Remove – Removes the selected group from exclusion. Confirmation is not requested.

    **CAUTION:** If an account is removed by group, use the **Cancel** button to discard the change.

- Edit – Opens the Add or Edit GID window to edit a selected group for exclusion. See the
  [Add or Edit GID Window](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/outputs/gidexclusions/addeditgid.md) topic for additional information.

The table lists groups that are being excluded from monitoring, displayed in the GID column. By
default, no groups are being excluded.
