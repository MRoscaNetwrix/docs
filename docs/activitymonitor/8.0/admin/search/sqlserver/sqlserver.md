# SQL Server Search Query

You can search SQL Server activity that has been monitored and recorded to a File output. When you
select **SQL Server** from the magnifying glass drop-down menu, a New Search tab opens with the
applicable query filters.

The filters are separated into the following categories:

- General
- User
- SQL

By default, the query is set to return all event activity for the past day. Configuring query
filters will scope results returned.

Set the filters as desired and click **Search**. The application searches through the appropriate
activity log files and returns the events that match the filters. You can
[Filter](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/search/overview.md#filter) and [Sort](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/search/overview.md#sort) the results using the column
headers. Below the Search button is the [Export](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/search/overview.md#export) option.

Filter Value Entry

When the drop-down menu is in front of a query filter, it is used to show or hide the filter entry
field. Field options vary based on the selected query filter:

- Textbox – Enter the filter value. If the field has a drop-down arrow, then you can select from
  values known to the application.
- Gray drop-down menu – Provides options to match the value against on of the following, which vary
  based on the filter:

    - Selected values – Filters by the value selected from the drop-down menu for the textbox
    - Simple string with wildcards – Filters by the value entered into the textbox, which contains
      an asterisk (\*) as the wildcard
    - Regular expression – Filters by the Regex entered into the textbox
