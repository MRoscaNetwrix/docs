# Archiving Tab

By default, the Activity Monitor keeps the activity logs on the servers where the activity agents
are deployed. The Archiving tab provides users with options to enable archiving for the activity
agent and move the archived files to another location on the server or to a network location.

The Days to keep Log files option, listed under the Log Files tab within Host Properties, applies to
Archive log files. When the entered number of days entered have passed, the activity logs and
Archive log files are deleted. The path to the Archive log files is next to the Configure button,
and listed under the Archive Location column within the Agents tab.

Check the Enable archiving for this agent box to enable the options on this tab. The archive feature
is disabled by default.

- Disk Quota — Maximum disk space the agent is allowed to use on the server it is installed on (at

  activity agent. When archiving is enabled, this is the default selection. Click Configure to open

this path for archiving.
