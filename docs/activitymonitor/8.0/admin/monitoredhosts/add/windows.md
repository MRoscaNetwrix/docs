Understanding File Activity Monitoring

The Activity Monitor can be configured to monitor the following:

- Ability to collect all or specific file activity for specific values or specific combinations of
  values

It provides the ability to feed activity data to SIEM products. The following dashboards have been
specifically created for Activity Monitor event data:

- For IBM® QRadar®, see the
  [Netwrix File Activity Monitor App for QRadar](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/siem/qradar/overview.md) for additional
  information.
- For Splunk®, see the [File Activity Monitor App for Splunk](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/siem/splunk/overview.md) for
  additional information.

It also provides the ability to feed activity data to other Netwrix products:

- Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor)
- Netwrix Threat Manager

Prior to adding a Windows host to the Activity Monitor, the prerequisites for the target environment
must be met. See the
[Windows File Server Activity Auditing Configuration](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/requirements/activityagent/activity_5.md)
topic for additional information.

_Remember,_ the Activity Agent must be deployed to the server. It cannot be deployed to a proxy
server.

## Add Agent's Windows Host

Follow the steps to add a Windows host to be monitored, if it was not configured when the agent was
deployed.

**Step 1 –** In Activity Monitor, go to the Monitored Hosts tab and click Add. The Add New Host
window opens.

![Choose Agent](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/chooseagent.webp)

**Step 2 –** On the Choose Agent page, select the **Agent** to monitor deployed on the Windows file
server. Click **Next**.

![Add Host page with Windows selected](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/addhostwindows.webp)

**Step 3 –** On the Add Host page, select the Agent’s Windows host radio button. Remember, the agent
must be deployed on the Windows file server to be monitored. If desired, add a **Comment**. Click
**Next**.

![Protocols page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/protocolspage.webp)

**Step 4 –** On the Protocols page, select which protocols to monitor. The protocols that can be
monitored are:

- All
- CIFS
- NFS

Click **Next**.

![Configure Operations page for Windows host](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/configureoperationswindows.webp)

**Step 5 –** On the Configure Operations page, select the **File Operations**,**Directory
Operations**, **Share Operations** and **VSS Opertions** to be monitored. Users may also filter
events by operation type by selecting the radio button:

- All – Reports both allowed and denied operations
- Allowed only – Reports only allowed operations
- Denied only – Reports only denied operations

Additional options include:

**CAUTION:** Enabling the Suppress subsequent Read operations in the same folder option can result
in Read events not being monitored.

- Suppress subsequent Read operations in the same folder – Logs only one Read operation when
  subsequent Read operations occur in the same folder. This option is provided to improve overall
  performance and reduce output log volume.
- Suppress reporting of File Explorer's excessive directory traversal activity – Filters out events
  of excessive directory traversal in File Explorer.
- Suppress Permission Change operations with reordered ACL – Prevents tracking events where
  permission updates occurred resulting in reordered ACEs (Access Control Entries) but with no other
  changes in the ACL (Access Control List). For example, if a user is removed in the security
  settings of a file, and then the same user is added back with the same security permissions, the
  change is not logged.
- Suppress Inherited Permission Changes – Filters out events for inherited permission changes. This
  option is provided to improve overall performance and reduce output activity log volume.
- Suppress Microsoft Office operations on temporary files – Filters out events for Microsoft Office
  temporary files. When Microsoft Office files are saved or edited, many temporary files are
  created. With this option enabled, events for these temporary files are ignored.

Click **Next**.

![Configure Basic Options page for Windows](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/configurebasicoptionswindows.webp)

**Step 6 –** On the Configure Basic Options page, choose which settings to enable. The “Log files”
are the activity logs created by the activity agent on the target host. Select the desired options:

- Report Account Names – Adds an Account Name column in the generated TSV files
- Report UNC paths – Adds a UNC Path column and a Rename UNC Path column in the generated TSV files
    - This option corresponds to the REPORT_UNC_PATH parameter in the INI file. It is disabled by
      default. The UNC Path is in the following format:
        - For CIFS activity – \\[HOST]\[SHARE]\[PATH]
        - Example CIFS activity – \\ExampleHost\TestShare\DocTeam\Temp.txt
    - When the option is enabled, the added columns are populated when a file is accessed remotely
      through the UNC Path. If a file is accessed locally, these columns are empty. These columns
      have also been added as Syslog macros.
- Report operations with millisecond precision – Changes the timestamps of events being recorded in
  the TSV log file for better ordering of events if multiple events occur within the same second

Click **Next**.

![Where to log activity page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/wheretologgeneric.webp)

**Step 7 –** On the Where To Log The Activity page, select whether to send the activity to either a
**Log File)** or **Syslog Server**. Click **Next**.

![File Output page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/fileouputpage.webp)

**Step 8 –** If **Log File)** is selected on the **Where To Log The Activity** page, the **File
Output** page can be configured.

- Specify output file path – Specify the file path where log files are saved. Click the ellipses
  button (**...**) to open the Windows Explorer to navigate to a folder destination. Click **Test**
  to test if the path works.
- Period to keep Log files – Log files will be deleted after the period entered number of days
  entered. The default is 10 days. Use the dropdown to specify whether to keep the Log files for a
  set amount of Minutes, Hours, or Days.
- This log file is for Access Analyzer – Enable this option to have Access Analyzer collect this
  monitored host configuration

    **_RECOMMENDED:_** Identify the configuration to be read by Access Analyzer when integration is
    available.

    - While Activity Monitor can have multiple configurations per host, Access Analyzer can only
      read one of them.

Click **Next**.

![Syslog Output page](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/syslogoutputpage.webp)

**Step 9 –** If Syslog Server is selected on the **Where To Log The Activity** page, the Syslog
Output page can be configured.

- Syslog server in SERVER[:PORT] format – Type the **Syslog server name** with a SERVER:Port format
  in the textbox.
    - The server name can be short name, fully qualified name (FQDN), or IP Address, as long as the
      organization’s environment can resolve the name format used. The Event stream is the activity
      being monitored according to this configuration for the monitored host.
- Syslog Protocol – Identify the **Syslog protocol** to be used for the Event stream. The drop-down
  menu includes:

    - UDP
    - TCP
    - TLS

    The TCP and TLS protocols add the Message framing drop-down menu. See the
    [Syslog Tab](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/outputs/syslog/syslog.md) topic for additional information.

- The Test button sends a test message to the Syslog server to check the connection. A green check
  mark or red will determine whether the test message has been sent or failed to send. Messages vary
  by Syslog protocol:

    - UDP – Sends a test message and does not verify connection
    - TCP/TLS – Sends test message and verifies connection
    - TLS – Shows error if TLS handshake fails

    See the [Syslog Tab](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/outputs/syslog/syslog.md) topic for additional information.

Click **Finish**.

![Activity Monitor with Windows Host added](/img/product_docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/add/activitymonitorwindows.webp)

The added Windows file server host is displayed in the monitored hosts table. Once a host has been
added for monitoring, configure the desired ouptuts. See the
[Output for Monitored Hosts](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/admin/monitoredhosts/output/output.md) topic for additional information.

## Host Properties for Windows File Server

Configuration settings can be edited through the tabs in the host’s Properties window. The
configurable host properties are:
