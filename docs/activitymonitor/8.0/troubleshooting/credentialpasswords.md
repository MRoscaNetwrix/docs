# Update Credential Passwords

Credential passwords occasionally need to be updated due to various reasons, such as security
policies that require passwords to be reset on a regular basis. The following types of credentials
may be impacted by password changes or security policies:

- Agent and Domain Controller User Account
- Archive User Account
- Panzura MQ Protection
- Monitored Host User Account
- Active Directory Domain / DC User Account
- Agent Inactivity Alerts Email Credentials
- Monitored Host Inactivity Alerts Email Credentials

## Agent and Domain Controller User Account

The Active Directory Domain / DC User Account is used to run the actions performed by the agent. The
account can be updated in the agent properties under the **Connection** tab.

:::note
If the AD monitoring account is changed, all accounts on the domain controllers will need
to be updated as well.
