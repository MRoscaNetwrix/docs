# File Search Query

You can search Windows file server and NAS device activity that has been monitored and recorded to a
File output. When you select **File** from the magnifying glass drop-down menu, a New Search tab
opens with the applicable query filters.

By default, the query is set to return all event activity for the past day. Configuring query
filters will scope results returned.

Set the filters as desired and click **Search**. The application searches through the appropriate
activity log files and returns the events that match the filters. You can
[Filter](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/activitymonitor/admin/search/overview.md#filter) and [Sort](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/activitymonitor/admin/search/overview.md#sort) the results using the column
headers. Below the Search button is the [Export](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/activitymonitor/admin/search/overview.md#export) option.

Filter Value Entry

Field options vary based on the selected query filter:

- Textbox – Enter the filter value. If the field has a drop-down arrow, then you can select from
  values known to the application.
- Gray drop-down menu – Provides options to match the value against on of the following, which vary
  based on the filter:

    - Selected values – Filters by the value selected from the drop-down menu for the textbox
    - Simple string with wildcards – Filters by the value entered into the textbox, which contains
      an asterisk (\*) as the wildcard
    - Regular expression – Filters by the Regex entered into the textbox

## Query Filter Options

The sections have the following filters:

- Events time range – The time frame filter must be configured for every search query:

    - From – Set the date and timestamp for the start of the activity range. The drop-down menu
      opens a calendar.
    - To – Set the date and timestamp for the end of the activity range. The drop-down menu opens a
      calendar.

- File Path – Filter the data for a specific file path where activity has occurred
- Hosts – Filter the data for a specific target host of the event
- Source – Filter the data for a specific source of the activity:

    - For local Windows activity, filter by a process name like notepad.exe
    - For network Windows activity, filter by the IP Address of the user
    - For NAS device activity, filter by the IP Address for the NAS device of the user

- User/Group – Filter the data for a specific user, or perpetrator of the event. You can also filter
  by a group.

    - Specify account or group (...) – The ellipsis button beside the User textbox opens the Specify
      account or group window. Use this window to resolve the account for the user. See the
      [Specify Account or Group Window](/docs/activitymonitor/8.0/activitymonitor/admin/outputs/window/specifywindowsaccount.md) topic for
      additional information.
