# Requirements

This topic describes the recommended configuration of the servers needed to install the application in a production environment. Depending on the size of the organization, it is recommended to review your environment and requirements with a Netwrix engineer prior to deployment to ensure all exceptions are covered.

## Architecture Overview

The following servers are required for installation of the application:

Core Component

- Activity Monitor Console Server – This is where the v8.0 application is installed.

  __NOTE:__ The Activity Monitor Console can be hosted on the same machine as other Netwrix products.

  - Activity Agent – The Activity Agent is installed on Windows servers to monitor Microsoft Entra ID, Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, SharePoint farms, SharePoint Online, SQL Server, and Windows file servers. See the [Activity Agent Server Requirements](activityagent.md) topic for additional information.
  - AD Agent – The AD Agent is deployed to every domain controllers to monitor Active Directory domains. See the [AD Agent Server Requirements](adagent.md) topic for additional information.
  - Linux Agent – The Linux Agent is deployed to Linux servers to be monitored. See the [Linux Agent Server Requirements](linuxagent.md) topic for additional information.
