| 1) Sub-Operation  2) Old Attributes  3) New Attributes | Windows hosts only. These columns are filled with details about:   - Permission changes (the “Per” operation type) - Attribute Changes (the “Upd” operation type) - Read events from VSS shadow copies   See the Sub-Operation, Old Attributes, and New Attributes Table section for additional details. |
| User Name | Username in NTAccount format. This column is dependent upon the “Report account names” option. |
| Protocol | Protocol of the event, i.e. CIFS, NFS, or VSS |
| 1) UNC  2) Rename UNC Path | Network paths of remote activity. These columns are dependent upon the “Report UNC paths” option.   - For CIFS activity – Reported with the following format \\[SERVER]\[SHARE]\Folder\File.txt - For NFS activity – Reported with the following format[SERVER]:/[VOLUME]/Folder/File.txt |
| Volume ID | ID of the volume where the event occurred |
| Share Name | Share name where the event occurred. This column is dependent upon the “Report UNC paths” option. |
| Protocol Version | NetApp Data ONTAP Cluster-Mode devices only. Protocol version of the event, i.e. CIFS or NFS. The following values are potentially reported:   - For CIFS activity – 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1 - For NFS activity – 2, 3, 4, 4.1, 4.2 |
