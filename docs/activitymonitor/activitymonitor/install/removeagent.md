To only remove the server from the Agents list, click Remove. To also uninstall the activity agent from the server, click Uninstall and remove. During the uninstall process, the status will be Uninstalling. If there are any errors, the list of errors appears in the __Agent messages__ box. When the activity agent uninstall is complete, it is removed from the Agents list.
