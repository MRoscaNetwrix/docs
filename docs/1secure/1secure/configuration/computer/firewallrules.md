# Configure Windows Firewall Inbound Connection Rules

You need to configure the inbound connection rules in Windows Firewall on each target computer, where 'target computer' refers to a computer audited by 1Secure. These Windows Firewall settings can be managed through Group Policy settings. To do this, edit the GPO affecting your firewall settings. Navigate to:

```Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > Network Connections > Windows Firewall```

Select Domain Profile or Standard Profile (depending on the profile that is active on the host). Then enable the Allow inbound remote administration exception.

__Step 1 窶点_ On each computer audited by 1Secure, navigate to Start > Control Panel and select Windows Firewall.

__Step 2 窶点_ In the Help Protect your computer with Windows Firewall page, click __Advanced settings__ on the left.

__Step 3 窶点_ In the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security dialog, select Inbound Rules on the left.
