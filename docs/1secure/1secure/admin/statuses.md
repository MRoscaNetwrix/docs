# Statuses

Statuses in Netwrix 1Secure allow you check up the state of the system, specifically - sources, agent, and connectors. As you add your sources, connectors, install the agent, Netwrix 1Secure provides several statuses for these:

__NOTE:__ The New status changes to Healthy status when the agent finishes collection from the environment. The time frame for a change may be within a minute up to several hours depending on the environment size.

You can also review the agent status while adding the organization. See the [Manage Organizations](/docs/product_docs/1secure/1secure/admin/organizations/overview.md) topic for more information.
