Statuses in Netwrix 1Secure allow you check up the state of the system, specifically - sources,
agent, and connectors. As you add your sources, connectors, install the agent, Netwrix 1Secure
provides several statuses for these:

:::note
The New status changes to Healthy status when the agent finishes collection from the
environment. The time frame for a change may be within a minute up to several hours depending on the
environment size.

You can also review the agent status while adding the organization. See the
[Manage Organizations](/docs/1secure/admin/organizations/overview.md) topic for more information.
