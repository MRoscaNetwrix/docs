# Data Collection

The Netwrix 1Secure data collection workflow is as follows:

__Step 1 –__ Add organizations. See the [Add Organizations](../organizations/addorganizations.md) topic for additional information.

__Step 2 –__ Install the agent. See the [Install Agent](../../install/installagent.md)topic for additional information.

Once you have added the organization and selected the domain for collecting the data, Netwrix 1Secure starts collecting audit data from the managed Active Directory, Azure AD domain, a computer, an Exchange Online, or a SharePoint Online collection.
