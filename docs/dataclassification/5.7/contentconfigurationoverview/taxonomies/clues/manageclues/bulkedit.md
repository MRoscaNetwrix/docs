# Bulk Edit

The Bulk Edit link can be used to make changes to several clues at one time:

When this link is used the form changes into a grid editor and many values can be changes and saved
in a single operation. To alter the Mandatory or Is Local settings for all terms quickly simply
click the header text to toggle all checkboxes between enabled / disabled.

It is also possible to preview the changes made whilst in the bulk editor. The Preview functionality
provides an indication of the number of documents affected, and the resultant score change:
