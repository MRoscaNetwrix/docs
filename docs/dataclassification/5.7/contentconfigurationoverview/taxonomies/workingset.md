# Working Set

A Working Set of documents can be defined and used to test the accuracy of classification rules
against a controlled set of documents. The Working Set mode can be selected in the Core
Configuration.

If Class Level is selected then a different Working Set can be defined for every class. If Taxonomy
Level is selected then the same Working Set will be used for all classes.

Documents can be added to the Working Set from the Search or Browse tabs by using the Add to Working
Set links:
