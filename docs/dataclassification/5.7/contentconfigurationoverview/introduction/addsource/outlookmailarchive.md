Multiple mailboxes can be added at one time via the "+" button. Collection will process all folders
/ emails / attachments within the mailbox - associating the attachment text with the respective
email.

Select documents' images processing mode:

- Disabled – documents' images will not be processed.
- Default – defaults to the source settings if configuring a path or the global setting if
  configured on a source.
- Normal – images are processed with normal quality settings.
- Enhanced – upscale images further to allow more.

Folders / Items can be excluded from processing via the Exchange Exclusions management screen.
