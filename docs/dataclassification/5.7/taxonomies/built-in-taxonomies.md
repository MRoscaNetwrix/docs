# Built-in Taxonomies Overview

Netwrix Data Classification comes with eight taxonomies with hundreds of classification rules
out-of-the-box.

The four core taxonomies cover a broad range of sensitive personal, financial, and health-related
information. The remaining four taxonomies derive from the core set. They are tailored to meet the
requirements of specific data protection regulations:

- Personally identifiable information covering GDPR scope.
- Medical records covering HIPAA scope.
- Financial records and payment cards information covering GLBA and PCI DSS scope.

This section contains the full list of built-in taxonomies supported by Netwrix Data Classification.

**NOTE:** Netwrix Data Classification users can see only the taxonomies they have permissions to
use. See the [User Management](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/configuration/security/user-management.md) section for more information on
users' permissions.

## Sensitive and Non-Sensitive Taxonomies

While creating your own reports, you can specify whether a taxonomy is sensitive (finance,
сredentials) or non-sensitive (file size, language).

**NOTE:** This applies only to customized taxonomies, which you add by yourself. You cannot change
the sensitivity settings for the pre-defined taxonomies.

Follow the steps to specify sensitive taxonomy.

**Step 1 –** Add a new taxonomy. See the [Add a Taxonomy](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/taxonomies/create-taxonomy.md) topic for additional information.

**Step 2 –** Navigate to Taxonomies > Global Settings > Edit. The **Edit** panel displays.

**Step 3 –** Select Sensitive Taxonomy.
