# Workflow Actions

Actions are automated operation to be performed with the documents when rule conditions are
triggered. There are two types of workflow actions:

- Generic actions available for any type of document. These are:

  - [Email Alert](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/workflows/actions/email-alert.md)
  - Migration
  - [Apply Additional Classification](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/workflows/advanced-configuration/classification.md)

- Source-specific actions

Workflow actions are executed at the final stage of the document processing.
