# Configuration Backup

:::note
Only available for ‘Superusers’
:::


The Backup utility allows for the migration of complex Netwrix Data Classification instance
configurations.

This allows a user to safely design and test a Netwrix Data Classification configuration within a
development environment and then copy the configuration, or specific parts of the configuration, to
a different environment (I.E production).

The tool supports text replacement to allow user defined URL's to be replaced by the equivalent
destination URL. The following configuration options are available for import / export:

- Source Registrations
- SharePoint Termset Registrations
- Workflow Configurations
- Core Configuration Options:

    - Files Excluded
    - Files Included
    - Mapped Metadata Fields
    - Mapped Metadata Values
    - Supported Languages
    - Pages Excluded
    - Pages Included
    - SharePoint Excluded
    - Text Patterns
