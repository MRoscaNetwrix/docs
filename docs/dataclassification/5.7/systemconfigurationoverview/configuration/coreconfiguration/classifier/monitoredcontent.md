# MonitoredContent

You can decrease the Classifier load, targeting it at _monitored content_ only. This means that you
can schedule content to be automatically re-classified only when a specific condition or set of
conditions are met, or with a minimum time period between runs.

**NOTE:** Each option in this section has an associated “**i**” which describes the nature of the
setting.

| Monitored Document Indicator               | Content will be marked for automatic re-classification if it is tagged with a particular term.                             | Click on the tag icon to select the term that should be used to identify monitored content.                     |
| Minimum Reclassification Regularity (days) | Defines the minimum period to be used when re-classifying monitored content: from _1_ to _180_ days, default is **1** day. | Content will be marked for reclassification if it was last classified prior to the specified regularity period. |
