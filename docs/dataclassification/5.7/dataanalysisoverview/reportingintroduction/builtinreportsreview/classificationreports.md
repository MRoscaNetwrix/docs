Review the list of the built-in classification reports:

- **Auto Classification Log** —Reports on changes to the classifications applied to documents,
  specifically tags added/removed. To log classification changes, enable the related option in the
  product configuration; see [Manage Reports](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/dataanalysisoverview/reportingintroduction/manage.md) for details.

- Classification Coverage—Provides a list of documents that have been tagged with X or fewer
  classifications. Assists in locating documents that have a low number of auto classifications and
  highlights the nearest missed classification. Supports filtering by URL and source group.
- Clue Counts—Provides a report of the number of clues per term, also includes a count of regular
  expression clues.
- **Hit Counts**— Provides a grouped summary of hit counts per taxonomy or class - identifying the
  numbers of times the regular expressions used for auto-classification have been identified within
  the indexed corpus.
- **Reused Terms** - Provides an information on the reused terms feature. You use it when you want
  the settings of one term to be applied in the other one automatically.
- Sensitive Documents — Provides a report of classifications of crawled content against sensitive
  taxonomies.
