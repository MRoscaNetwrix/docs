# Reviewing SharePoint Dashboard

The SharePoint dashboard is similar to the main reporting dashboard, with the results filtered to
SharePoint types. See [Operations and Health Dashboards](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/reporting/dashboards/index.md) for more
information on the reporting dashboard.

To open the SharePoint dashboard:

1. In the main window, click **SharePoint** tab.
2. Select **Dashboard** on the left.

Here you can examine:

- **Index size** diagram that shows index size for various entities (subsites, libraries, etc.)
- **Classification coverage** diagram that identifies the percentage of content that has had
  classifications applied, and the percentage that has not.
