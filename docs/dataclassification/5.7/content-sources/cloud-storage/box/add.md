# Box

Use the **Box** source configuration window to set up the crawling and classification operations for
content stored in a Box Enterprise account.

By default, configuration window displays basic configuration settings only. It is recommended that
you click the "wrench" icon in the bottom left corner to configure advanced settings.

**NOTE:** To configure advanced settings, your user account may need advanced privileges.

| Email Address                                  | Specify one or more users (email addresses) for impersonated crawling. - If specified explicitly, the crawling engine will impersonate these users when crawling their content as well as shared content where they are the owners. Enter one or several accounts from those listed in the _Managed Users_ on the '_Users and Groups_' tab of the Box console. - If not specified explicitly, the program will automatically create and use an admin user account (_NDC Crawling Account_) for crawling. Remember to provide this app user account with sufficient permissions for the content you want to index (i.e. share access). To share content for crawling with this account, use group membership. |
| Re-Index Period                                | Specifies how often the source should be checked for changes (period in days).
