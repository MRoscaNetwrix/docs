# Content Sources

A _content source_ in terms of Netwrix Data Classification is a repository of data to be crawled and
classified. Each content source has an individual configuration and, where appropriate, credentials.

For adding and managing content sources, use the **Content Configuration**â†’Sources area of the
Netwrix Data Classification management console.

**IMPORTANT!** To access the **Sources** area, users require sufficient rights. See the
[User Management](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/configuration/security/user-management.md) section for more information.

You can manage the individual content sources or organize them into source groups, which are used as
logical containers.

**NOTE:** You can configure the unlimited number of sources to work with.

# Narrow Data Collection Scope

Inclusions and exclusions provide a granular way of limiting collection scope to a specific set of
documents within a content source.

This functionality is currently supported for the following source types:

- Exchange
- File System
- Google Drive

[Exchange Mailbox](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/content-sources/exchange/mailbox.md)
