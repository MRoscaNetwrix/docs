# Exchange Server

The Exchange Server source configuration screen allows you to enable the crawling and classification
of multiple Exchange mailboxes from the same Exchange server.

**IMPORTANT!** Automatic detection, crawling and classification of multiple Exchange mailboxes from
the same Exchange server (and, respectively, _Exchange Server_ content source configuration) is only
supported for Exchange Server 2013 or later due to limitations in the Microsoft APIs. For earlier
versions, consider using _Exchange Mailbox_ content source.

You can use Match Rules to include and exclude the certain mailboxes.

Follow the steps to configure an Exchange Server source.

**Step 1 –** In Netwrix Data Classification management console, open the **Sources** view and click
**Add**.

**Step 2 –** Select **Exchange** source type and in the properties window specify the necessary
settings.

**Step 3 –** Remember to click the "wrench" icon next to **Settings** in the bottom-left corner to
display all settings.

## Authentication type: Basic

If you plan to use this authentication type, you will need to specify the following:

| Option                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email Address / Password | Administrator account that has been assigned the right of Impersonation as well as the Discovery Management role. See [Configure Microsoft Exchange for Crawling and Classification](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/configuration/infrastructure/exchange/index.md) for details on the rights assignment. |

## Other configuration settings

The following settings are also required in both cases:

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exchange API URL | By default, the crawling engine will attempt to locate the necessary URL of Exchange Web Services API by using the _Exchange AutoDiscover_ functionality. So, typically, you can leave this field blank. If, however, the _Exchange AutoDiscover_ is not available, then you should specify the Exchange API URL explicitly as follows: `https://<servername>/EWS/Exchange.asmx`. |
| Crawl Range      | Define what portions of data should be retrieved from the Exchange server: - Select **Date Range** to crawl a static set of data within the required interval. - Select **Since** if you want to periodically re-crawl content from the specified date, taking into account the last crawl date for each artifact.                                                                |
| Match Rules      | Define which mailboxes will be crawled as part of an Exchange Server source. Examples: 1. `.*@netwrix.com`— enter the wildcard (\*) and the domain (here `netwrix.com`) to restrict crawling to a set of domain mailboxes 2. `.*`—enter if you want all mailboxes to be crawled                                                                                                   |
| Detection Period | Specify how often the source should be checked for changes. Default period is 1 day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Having specified all the necessary settings, click the **Save** button.
