# Built-in Reports

Netwrix Data Classification offers a number of built-in reports and charts that refer to indexing
and classification process and results, as well to the system operation. They can be run in browser,
as well as exported to Excel or CSV files. [See Manage Reports for more information.](/docs/dataclassification/5.7/admin/reporting/manage.md)

reports with the required data.

1. In the management console, select **System
   Configuration**→**Config**→**Settings**→**System**→**Classifier**.
