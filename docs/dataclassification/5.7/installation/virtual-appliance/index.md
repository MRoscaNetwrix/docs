# Virtual Deployment

In addition to traditional on-premises deployment, Netwrix Data Classification now offers new
deployment options that can speed time-to-value by getting you up and running in less than 15
minutes.

Virtual appliance â€” If you run a Microsoft Hyper-V or VMware vSphere, you can deploy Netwrix Data
Classification as a virtual appliance. Virtual appliance is a VM image file with installed Netwrix
Data Classification. The image is also configured to use Microsoft Edge as a default web browser.

The following configuration options available:

- Generalized Windows Server 2022, 180-day evaluation version.
- Generalized Windows Server 2019, 180-day evaluation version.
