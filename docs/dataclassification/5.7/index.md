# Netwrix Data Classification 5.7

> **Identify and protect sensitive data across your entire organization**

Netwrix Data Classification automatically discovers and classifies sensitive data across file servers, SharePoint, and other repositories. It enables organizations to understand what data they have, where it resides, and who has access to it, helping to reduce risk and ensure compliance.
