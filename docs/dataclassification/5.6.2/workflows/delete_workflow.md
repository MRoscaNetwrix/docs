# Delete Workflow

You can delete a single workflow or a group of workflows within the scope (Global or other):

- To delete all workflows in the scope, in the **Workflows** list select the necessary **Name**
  (scope) and click **Delete** on the right.
- To delete specific workflow, do the following:

    1. In the list of workflows, locate the workflow you need.

    **TIP:** You can use **Search** in the upper right corner of the window.

    2. Click the link in the **Name** column for the required workflow (Global for Google Drive in
