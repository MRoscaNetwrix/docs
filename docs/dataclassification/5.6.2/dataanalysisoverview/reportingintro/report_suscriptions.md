# Report Subscriptions

Subscriptions for report templates enable you to schedule email delivery of a variety of reports or
set of specific search criteria. Subscriptions are helpful if you are a rare guest of Netwrix Data
Classification and you only need to get statistics based on individual criteria. For example, an IT
manager can easily provide auditors with weekly reports to prove compliance with regulations.

To view existing subscriptions for reports, navigate to the **Report Templates** page on the left
and click **View Subscriptions** next to an existing template to view and edit subscriptions.

Checking the **Create a Subscription** box when saving a new report configuration will enable users
to create a new subscription. The following options are configured on the **Manage Subscriptions**
