# Reporting Capabilities

Selecting **Analysis** → Reports in the management console helps a user extract a wealth of
information from the NDC index.

The main **Dashboard** has three high level graphs highlighting the current state of processing:

- Document Progress—A graphical display of the main stats display, once processing is complete
  documents will be allocated to either Fully Processed or Errors
- Index Size—Shows the percentage of each source type being processed
- Classification Coverage—Shows the percentage of classified content, broken down by type, and the
  percentage of content that has not received any auto-classifications

It is possible to filter and refine data presentation to look for the areas that contain the largest
amount of documents tagged with a particular term, or to only review specific content.

Reporting capabilities also include the following:

- [Content Distribution Map](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/dataanalysisoverview/reportingintro/content_distribution.md)
- [Built-in Reports](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/dataanalysisoverview/reportingintro/reportingbuiltin/reporting_built-in.md)
