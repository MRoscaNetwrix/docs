# Built-in Reports

Netwrix Data Classification offers a number of built-in reports and charts that refer to indexing
and classification process and results, as well to the system operation. They can be run in browser,
as well as exported to Excel or CSV files. See Manage Reports for more information.

**NOTE:** For some reports, **Auto-classification change logging** must be enabled to supply the
reports with the required data.

To enable Auto-Classification change logging

1. In the management console, select **System
   Configuration**→**Config**→**Settings**→**System**→**Classifier**.
2. Select the **Auto-Classification Change Log** option.
3. Click **Save**.
