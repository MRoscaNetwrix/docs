# Built-in Taxonomies Overview

Netwrix Data Classification comes with eight taxonomies with hundreds of classification rules
out-of-the-box.

The four core taxonomies cover a broad range of sensitive personal, financial, and health-related
information. The remaining four taxonomies derive from the core set. They are tailored to meet the
requirements of specific data protection regulations:

- Personally identifiable information covering GDPR scope.
- Medical records covering HIPAA scope.
- Financial records and payment cards information covering GLBA and PCI DSS scope.

This section contains the full list of built-in taxonomies supported by Netwrix Data Classification.

**NOTE:** Netwrix Data Classification users can see only the taxonomies they have permissions to
use. See the
[User Management](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/security/user_management.md) section
for more information on users' permissions.

## Sensitive and Non-Sensitive Taxonomies

While creating your own reports, you can specify whether a taxonomy is sensitive (finance,
сredentials) or non-sensitive (file size, language).

**NOTE:** This applies only to customized taxonomies, which you add by yourself. You cannot change
the sensitivity settings for the pre-defined taxonomies.

To specify sensitive taxonomy:

1. Add a new taxonomy. See the
   [Add a Taxonomy](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/taxonomies/taxonomy_add.md) article
   for details.
2. Navigate to Taxonomies →Global Settings → Edit. The **Edit** panel displays.
3. Select Sensitive Taxonomy.
