**NOTE:** To manage the automated workflows, users require sufficient access rights that are
assigned based on either their Windows identity or using non-Windows based access controls. See
"Users" for details on rights and permissions.

- Click **Copy** if you want to copy the list content to the clipboard.
- You can also export the list to **CSV** or **XLSX** file.
- By default, the number of list items displayed (**Page Size**) is set to **10**. Modify this
  setting as necessary.
- To delete all workflows from a certain scope, select the corresponding list item and click
  **Delete**.

## Creating a Workflow

To create an automated workflow for certain type of documents, you can use the Add Workflow wizard
or **Advanced** dialogs.

See next:

- [Create a Workflow using Add Workflow Wizard](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/workflows-automation/workflow-management/creating-workflows.md)
- Configuring a Workflow Using Advanced Dialog

## Modifying or Deleting a Workflow

To modify a workflow, follow the steps described in the
[Edit Workflow settings](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/workflows-automation/workflow-management/workflow-settings.md)
section.

To delete a workflow, follow the steps described in the
[Delete Workflow](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/workflows-automation/workflow-management/workflow-settings.md)section.

## Cloning, Enabling or Renaming a Workflow

1. Click the link in the **Name** column for the required workflow ( e.g. Global for Google Drive in
   the figure below):

![workflow_delete_single_thumb_0_0](/img/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/workflows/workflow_delete_single_thumb_0_0.webp)

2. This will open the list of workflows for selected scope. You can sort the list by **Details**
   (workflow action) or by **Active** (workflow state) field.
3. Select one or several workflows you need.
4. To **Disable** or **Enable** the workflow, use the corresponding button above or link on the
   right. Workflow state (**Active** field) will change accordingly.
5. If you want to create a copy of selected workflow, with all associated actions and conditions,
   click **Clone**, then enter the scope (group) and name for the new workflow.

**NOTE:** Workflows within a generic group (scope) are cloned within the same group, source-specific
workflows can be copied within any groups of the same type. The clone workflow will be disabled by
default.

![workflows_category_list_thumb_0_0](/img/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/workflows/workflows_category_list_thumb_0_0.webp)

To provide another name to a workflow, select it from the list and click **Rename**.

**NOTE:** Workflow names must be unique within the group (scope).

# Step 1. Select Content Type

At the first step of the wizard, select the type of content your workflow will process, and specify
which content sources of that type should be included in processing.

1. From the drop-down list, select what type of documents you want this workflow to target:
   - To apply the workflow to all types of content, selecting **All types**.
   - Otherwise, select what type of content you want to be included in the workflow:
     - Exchange
     - File
     - Google Drive
     - SQL
2. Then specify which source of content you want to process. You can select All sources, or select
   the one you need.

Click Next to proceed.

See also: [Content Sources](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/data-sources/managing-sources.md).

# Step 2. Select Action

After you select the required type of content source, you will be offered the number of automated
actions available for such content, for example, send an alert by email or update document metadata,
etc.

Click the action you need and configure the necessary settings. For details, see
[Available Actions](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/workflows-automation/workflow-actions/file-actions.md).

When finished, proceed to the next step.

# Step 4. Enter Name and Review Settings

At this step, you need to provide workflow name, review its settings, and disable or enable the
workflow (to start immediate processing). Do the following:

1. Enter workflow name. It should contain at least 3 characters.
2. Review the workflow settings you have configured at the previous steps.
3. If you want the documents to be processed immediately after you finish the wizard, select
   **Enabled** option. Otherwise, you can select **Disabled** and change this settings later on
   using the UI.

   **NOTE:** Documents that have already been classified will be re-classified before applying this
   automated workflow.

   the **Workflows** tab:
