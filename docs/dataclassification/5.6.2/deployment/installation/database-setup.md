# Configure NDC SQL database

Netwrix Data Classification uses Microsoft SQL Server database as metadata storage. During
installation, you have been prompted to create a dedicated NDC SQL database on your SQL Server
instance. Upon installation completion, you need to configure it as shown below for the product to
function properly. You can create the database manually prior to the product installation—Using SQL
Server Management Studio or Transact-SQL. Refer to the following Microsoft article for detailed
instructions on how to create a new database:
[Create a Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/create-a-database).

**NOTE:** For performance purposes, Netwrix strongly recommends to separate NDC and SQL Server
machine.

For certain product features, SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition is required.

**NOTE:** The account used to create the NDC SQL database must be granted the dbcreator server-level
role.

   All Programs → Microsoft SQL Server → SQL Server Management Studio.
