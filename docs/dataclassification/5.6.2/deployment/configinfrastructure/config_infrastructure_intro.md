# Configure IT Infrastructure

Successful crawling requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited
environment. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows
services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your
change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.
