# Classifier

The **Classifier** configuration tab contains the classification engine settings. By default, only
standard options are displayed. To view advanced options, click the "wrench" icon at **Settings** in
the bottom-right corner.

Each option has an associated “**i**” which describes the nature of the setting.
