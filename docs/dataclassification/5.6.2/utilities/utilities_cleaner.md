# Index Maintenance

**NOTE:** Only available for ‘Superusers’.

You may need to reprocess content or even clean the environment on a large scale —for example, after
a large amount of content has been deleted, or after configuring a DQS environment. In such
scenarios, index should also be maintained — to ensure data consistency. To automate maintenance
operations, you can use a built-in tool named Cleaner.

To launch the Cleaner tool

1. Open NDC Management Web Console.
2. Navigate to **Settings**→ **Config** and click **Run Cleaner**.
3. Then follow the steps of **Index Maintenance** wizard.
