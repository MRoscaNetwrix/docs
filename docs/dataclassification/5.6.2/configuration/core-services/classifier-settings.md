| Write Mode                             | Allows you to configure the update method that will be used by the Classification service to update SharePoint documents. Possible options: - **Alter audit information** - Simple Update operation - **Maintain audit information** - ValidateUpdateListItem operation - **Maintain audit information with no alerts (O365 only)** - SystemUpdate operation | Applies to SharePoint documents. |
| Manually Classify Cleared Fields       | When enabled, fields will be marked as manually classified if the user clears them. If disabled, auto classification must be manually turned off by the user to stop the field being updated.                                                                                                                                                                |                                  |
| Hide Sql (Local) Taxonomy Calculations | When disabled, any classifications/calculations will be hidden from the SharePoint View Classifications display (Classic and Modern UI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                  |
| Ignore Manual Classifications From     | A semicolon-delimetered list of usernames. Any updates to classification of new documents in SharePoint by these users will be ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                  |

| Redis Caching                          | Use _redis_ module to enable Classifier data caching between the core Windows services and NDC Servers.                                                                                                                                                             | This module can be downloaded from [https://github/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases.](https://github/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases) Install it locally and open port **6379** required for its operation. For details on servers cluster, see [Configuring NDC Servers Cluster and Load Balancing with DQS Mode](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/deployment/planning/deployment-modes.md) |
| Store Trimmed Classification           | Enables storing trimmed classifications in SQL (due to max category settings at the global or subset level).                                                                                                                                                        | When enabled, classification performance will be improved —however, this will result in additional data within the SQL database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Enable Standard Clue Metadata Matching | By default, standard clues are matched against the extracted text, index text, summary, and title. Use this option if you want to match standard clues also on values found in the document's metadata.                                                             | To ensure accurate classification results, we recommend running an index rebuild operation after enabling this mode (use Run Cleaner button).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Disable Unclassified Regex Extraction  | By default, any regular expression clue will result in additional metadata being added to a document, based on the extracted value(s). Use this option if you want to only extract values for clues on nodes that have achieved their threshold for classification. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

# Monitored Content

You can decrease the Classifier load, targeting it at _monitored content_ only. This means that you
can schedule content to be automatically re-classified only when a specific condition or set of
conditions are met, or with a minimum time period between runs.

**NOTE:** Each option in this section has an associated “**i**” which describes the nature of the
setting.

| Monitored Document Indicator               | Content will be marked for automatic re-classification if it is tagged with a particular term.                             | Click on the tag icon to select the term that should be used to identify monitored content.                     |
| Minimum Reclassification Regularity (days) | Defines the minimum period to be used when re-classifying monitored content: from _1_ to _180_ days, default is **1** day. | Content will be marked for reclassification if it was last classified prior to the specified regularity period. |

To re-classify content that meets specific conditions:

1. Use tagging. Content will be marked for automatic re-classification if it is tagged with a
   particular term.
2. In the **Monitored Content** section of **System Configuration > Core > Classifier** locate
   **Monitored Document Indicator**.
3. Click on the tag icon, and in the **Select Term** dialog specify the term that should be used to
   identify monitored content:

   When finished, click **Select**, then in the Classifier settings window click **Save**,

To re-classify content with a minimum time period between runs:

1. In the **Monitored Content** section of **System Configuration > Core > Classifier** settings
   window locate **Minimum Reclassification Regularity**.
2. Default reclassification period is 1 day. Use the slider to adjust the value. Content will be
   marked for reclassification if it was last classified prior to the specified period.
3. Click **Save**.

# Classifier

The **Classifier** configuration tab contains the classification engine settings. By default, only
standard options are displayed. To view advanced options, click the "wrench" icon at **Settings** in
the bottom-right corner.

Each option has an associated “**i**” which describes the nature of the setting.
