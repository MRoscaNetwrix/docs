# Content Sources

A _content source_ in terms of Netwrix Data Classification is a repository of data to be crawled and
classified. Each content source has an individual configuration and, where appropriate, credentials.

For adding and managing content sources, use the **Content Configuration**â†’Sources area of the
Netwrix Data Classification management console.

**IMPORTANT!** To access the **Sources** area, users require sufficient rights. See the
[User Management](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/systemconfigurationoverview/users/user_management.md) section
for more information.

You can manage the individual content sources or organize them into source groups, which are used as
logical containers.

**NOTE:** You can configure the unlimited number of sources to work with.
