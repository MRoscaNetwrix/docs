# SharePoint Online

Microsoft OneDrive is the default document library in a user's MySite in SharePoint Server or in
Microsoft 365. The contents of this library can optionally be synchronized with one or more of the
user's computers or devices.

Office 365 customers can configure the collector service to automatically detect and queue their
employees OneDrive (Personal Sites) hosted in Office 365. An account with Tenant administration
rights must be supplied, and the frequency of the detection of new One Drive sites must be set. It
is also possible to provide a filter expression to ensure that certain OneDrive paths are included
and others excluded as required.

Optionally, it is also possible to set up the resources necessary to ensure Netwrix Data
Classification is enabled and configured on the detected OneDrive sites. Templating allows an
administrator to pre-configure classification configurations for site collections. For more
information please review the associated templating guide.

To crawl the data within SharePoint Online, you need to enable Multi-Factor Authentication:
