| **Destination Rename Mode**         | Specifies what action to take if a file exists at the destination with the same name. - **None** – overwrite the destination file or issue a “duplicate” error. **NOTE:** Behaviour depends on the migration destination. - **Append Number** - append a numeric counter as a suffix to the file name (e.g. _document_2.txt)_. - **Append Date** - append workflow execution timestamp. |                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Maintain Folder Structure**       | If selected, subfolders will be created in the migration destination to match the relative path in the source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Applies if this capability is supported by the source system. For Exchange, the path will also include a folder for the mailbox name (e.g. _\\MigrationDestination\User@domain.com\Inbox\HR_). |
| **Delete Original Item**            | If selected, the original item will be deleted after it is successfully copied to the destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Applies if this capability is supported by the source system.                                                                                                                                  |

| **Redaction Plan**                  | If redaction plans have been configured, specify the redaction plan to be applied to the document. See [Redaction](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/systemconfigurationoverview/configuration/redaction.md).                                                                                                                                                                                            | By default, this will be applied to the document at the destination.                                                                                                                           |
| **Redact Original**                 | If updating the source item is supported by the source system, then checking this box will cause the redaction plan to be applied to the source document after being successfully migrated.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Note that this option is not available when performing a move (deleting the original item).                                                                                                    |
