# Built-in Reports

Netwrix Data Classification offers a number of built-in reports and charts that refer to indexing
and classification process and results, as well to the system operation. They can be run in browser,
as well as exported to Excel or CSV files. See Manage Reports for more information.

**NOTE:** For some reports, **Auto-classification change logging** must be enabled to supply the
reports with the required data.

To enable Auto-Classification change logging

1. In the management console, select **System
   Configuration**→**Config**→**Settings**→**System**→**Classifier**.
2. Select the **Auto-Classification Change Log** option.
3. Click **Save**.

# Reporting Capabilities

Selecting **Analysis** → Reports in the management console helps a user extract a wealth of
information from the NDC index.

The main **Dashboard** has three high level graphs highlighting the current state of processing:

- Document Progress—A graphical display of the main stats display, once processing is complete
  documents will be allocated to either Fully Processed or Errors
- Index Size—Shows the percentage of each source type being processed
- Classification Coverage—Shows the percentage of classified content, broken down by type, and the
  percentage of content that has not received any auto-classifications

It is possible to filter and refine data presentation to look for the areas that contain the largest
amount of documents tagged with a particular term, or to only review specific content.

Reporting capabilities also include the following:

- [Content Distribution Map](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/reporting-analytics/dashboards/content-distribution.md)
- [Built-in Reports](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/reporting-analytics/reports/built-in-reports.md)
