| Redis Caching                          | Use _redis_ module to enable Classifier data caching between the core Windows services and NDC Servers.                                                                                                                                                             | This module can be downloaded from [https://github/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases.](https://github/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases) Install it locally and open port **6379** required for its operation.

| Store Trimmed Classification           | Enables storing trimmed classifications in SQL (due to max category settings at the global or subset level).                                                                                                                                                        | When enabled, classification performance will be improved —however, this will result in additional data within the SQL database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Enable Standard Clue Metadata Matching | By default, standard clues are matched against the extracted text, index text, summary, and title. Use this option if you want to match standard clues also on values found in the document's metadata.                                                             | To ensure accurate classification results, we recommend running an index rebuild operation after enabling this mode (use Run Cleaner button).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Disable Unclassified Regex Extraction  | By default, any regular expression clue will result in additional metadata being added to a document, based on the extracted value(s). Use this option if you want to only extract values for clues on nodes that have achieved their threshold for classification. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
