# Classifier

The __Classifier__ configuration tab contains the classification engine settings. By default, only standard options are displayed. To view advanced options, click the "wrench" icon at __Settings__ in the bottom-right corner.

Each option has an associated “__i__” which describes the nature of the setting.
