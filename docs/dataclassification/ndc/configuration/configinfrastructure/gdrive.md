# Configure G Suite and Google Drive for Crawling

Netwrix Data Classification can crawl both: Personal Google Drives and G Suite domains. Netwrix Data
Classification for Google Drive uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate to your G Suite domain.
You will need to create a service account and authorize it to access data in individual and shared
Drives on behalf of users using the Google Drive API. Depending on your drive type, do the
following:

- [Сonfiguring G Suite for Crawling](#сonfiguring-g-suite-for-crawling)
- [Configuring Personal Google Drive for Crawling](#configuring-personal-google-drive-for-crawling)

## Сonfiguring G Suite for Crawling

In Google Cloud Platform web console:

1. Create a new project
2. Select Application type
3. Create a new service account
4. Create a service account key (JSON, save a copy for the data source configuration)
5. Enable G Suite domain-wide delegation for the service account (write down the Client ID)
6. Enable Google Drive API

In G Suite Admin Console:

1. Authorize service account to access the Google Drive API

To configure G Suite for crawling

**IMPORTANT!** Google administrative interfaces tend to change over time, so refer to the following
guide for up-to-data instructions on creating OAuth 2.0 service accounts:
[Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount).
