# Metadata Configuration

This section contains information on how to configure metadata of your documents. Review the following for additional information:

## Document Metadata Fields

This list specifies which internally generated fields are to be used:

## Metadata Field Mappings

This table allows additional metadata fields to be generated by mapping an already existing field name to a new name.

## Metadata Value Mappings

This list allows metadata values to be mapped from a source value to a new target value.

For example, if we create an entry for the field “Modified By”, with Source=”Cheryl Tweedy” and Target=”Cheryl Cole”, then a document with this metadata:

```“Modified By: Cheryl Tweedy;”```

Will generate an index with this metadata:

```“Modified By: Cheryl Cole;”```

This facility can be useful when you need to align metadata field values for example when employees change their name or are replaced by different people.

## Owner Mapping Priorities

This feature applies to the CSE-owner function for a workflow. Suppose, you want to email the documents after the classification to the CSE owner. Then you may need to specify what is the role you stand for these documents: Owner, Author, Creator, etc. You can prioritise any of these roles by clicking the![arrowup](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/configuration/arrowup.webp) or ![arrowadown](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/configuration/arrowadown.webp) arrows.

For example, if your document is owned or authored by you, but not modified or created, you may choose this priority:
