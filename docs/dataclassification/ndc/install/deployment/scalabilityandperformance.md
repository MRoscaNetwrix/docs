# Scalability and Performance

Scalability and performance testing revealed that based on the number of objects to classify, the environments can be ranged as follows:

| Number of objects to classify | Environment | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up to 1, 000, 000 | Proof-of-concept and small-size environment |  |
| Up to 16, 000, 000 | Mid-size environment |  |
| Up to 64, 000, 000 | Large-size environment |  |
| More than 64, 000, 000 | Extra-large environment | System architect's assistance is required for deployment planning in such environments. |

__IMPORTANT!__ For the large-size and extra-large environments, it is strongly recommended to configure a cluster of several NDC Servers and apply DQS mode to these clustered servers. See [Configuring NDC Servers Cluster and Load Balancing with DQS Mode](../../requirements/dqsmode.md) for details.
