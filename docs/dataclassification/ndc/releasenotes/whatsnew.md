# What's New in 5.7

## New Netwrix Community!

All Netwrix product announcements have moved to the new Netwrix Community. See announcements for Netwrix Data Classification in the [Data Classification](https://community.netwrix.com/c/data-classification/announcements/102) area of our new community.

The following information highlights the new and enhanced features introduced in this Netwrix Data Classification 5.7 version.

## New Features and Enhancements

New: Ability to crawl all tables in all databases on SQL server with a single configuration

New: Automatically locate sensitive data across your SQL databases so you can implement the appropriate security controls around it. See the [SQL Server ](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/sources/sqlserver/addsqlserversource.md) topic for additional information.

## Other Improvements

Improved: Wizard for ROT data removal

Avoid the headache of manually setting up the workflow for the removal of outdated records with the new wizard. See the [Step 3. Specify Conditions for Processing](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/workflows/step3specifyconditions.md) topic for additional information.

Improved: Improved Regex proximity

Further reduce the chance of false positives with improved Regex proximity so you can focus your security efforts on truly sensitive data. See the [Types of Clues](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/cluestypes.md) topic for additional information.

Improved: Improved data remediation

Reduce the risk of exposure of sensitive OCR data (images or pdfs) that failed to be redacted by automatically moving it to a dedicated location. See the [Migrate Document](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/workflows/actions/migratedocument.md) topic for additional information.

Improved: Ability to scan metadata

Speed classification of large amounts of data by first scanning the metadata associated with the files so you can take action on it. See the [Enable Write Classifications](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/enablewriteclassifications.md) topic for additional information.
