# Step 2: Maintenance Options

Specify options for the operation you have selected.

| Operation selected | Available options | Details |

| __Rebuild Index__ | __Shrink the "text.cse" file?__   - __Shrink__  - __Don't Shrink__ (default) | Selecting __Shrink__ will rebuild the _Text.cse_ file, removing any fragmentation. __Shrink__ will require sufficient disk space to process (up to the existing size of _Text.cse_) and may take some time to complete. |
| All operations | __Would you like to re-run the product configuration wizard?__   - __Run__ - __Don't Run__ (default) | Select __Run__ if you want to re-configure this instance by going through the initial steps of the product configuration. Note that this will pause all sources. |
