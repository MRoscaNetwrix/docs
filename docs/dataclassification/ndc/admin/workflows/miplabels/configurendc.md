1. In administrative web console, navigate to System →Config . In the tree view go to System  → MIP Configuration.
2. Complete the MIP Configuration wizard. Review the following mapping table:

   | Netwrix Data Classification | Microsoft Azure Application parameters (fields) |
   | --- | --- |
   | Client ID | Application (client) ID |
   | Application Name | Display name |
   | Tenant | Directory (tenant) ID |
   | Certificate Thumbprint | Provide certificate thumbprint you copied and stored on this step: [Upload the .CER file to Azure](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/workflows/miplabels/configureinfrastructure.md). |

__NOTE:__  Any labels and policies in API should be migrated / synced with O365 Security & Compliance. Review the following Microsoft article for more information: [To migrate Azure Information Protection labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-migrate-labels#to-migrate-azure-information-protection-labels)

__NOTE:__ If you have any problems applying MIP labels, reinstall C++ redistributable with current .exe file (https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc\_redist.x64.exe).
