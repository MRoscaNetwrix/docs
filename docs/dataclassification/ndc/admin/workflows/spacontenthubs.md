# SharePoint Content Type Hubs

SharePoint 2010+ supports Enterprise Content Types allowing Content Types to be defined on a Publishing SharePoint site with one or more secondary sites consuming the Enterprise Content Types.

Once Netwrix Data Classification for SharePoint is installed on the SharePoint Farm, it is possible to define SharePoint workflow actions at the SharePoint Content Type Hub site. Any actions of type Content Type Update may be run on the site collection itself however they may also be run on consuming SharePoint Site collections.
