# Plugins for Additional Actions

In addition to the common workflow actions provided out-of-the-box, you can set up additional actions using the plugins. Either use sample plugins from the vendor, or create your own custom plugins. Plugins should be stored in the dedicated folder, under _C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\Plugins\_.

The following sample plugins (implemented as DLLs) can be provided upon request:

- FTP Migration action
- Http Save Files action
- Twitter action
- SQL Lookup

To search for the plugins within default location, go to the __Plugins__ tab and click Detect Plugins.

Click the Enable link to enable selected plugins.

To modify workflow action implemented by a plugin, go to the __Configs__ tab and click __Action Configs__ on the left.
