# Content Sources

A _content source_ in terms of Netwrix Data Classification is a repository of data to be crawled and classified. Each content source has an individual configuration and, where appropriate, credentials.

For adding and managing content sources, use the __Content Configuration__â†’Sources area of the Netwrix Data Classification management console.

__IMPORTANT!__ To access the __Sources__ area, users require sufficient rights. See the [User Management](/docs/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/security/usermanagement.md) section for more information.

You can manage the individual content sources or organize them into source groups, which are used as logical containers.

__NOTE:__ You can configure the unlimited number of sources to work with.
