**Step 2 –** Select the source you need and configure its settings. See detailed instructions for
the sources:

- [Box](box/addbox.md)
- [Add Single Database](database/addsingledatabase.md) (Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle database)
- [Dropbox](dropbox/adddropbox.md)
- [Exchange Server](exchangemailbox/exchangeserver.md) or
  [Exchange Mailbox](exchangemailbox/exchangemailbox.md)
- [File System](filesystem/overview.md) (includes Folder and File)
- [Google Drive Source](googledrive/addgdsource.md)
- [Outlook Mail Archive](exchangemailbox/outlookmailarchive.md)
- [SharePoint](sharepoint/overview.md) or [SharePoint Online](sharepoint/sharepointonline.md)

All your content sources will be listed in the **Sources** section.

**NOTE:** When adding a source or managing source configuration, the most commonly used source
settings are displayed by default. However, some source types have additional configuration options
that can be displayed by clicking the Advanced Settings ("wrench" icon). You can allow these
advanced settings to be always shown to authorized users.
