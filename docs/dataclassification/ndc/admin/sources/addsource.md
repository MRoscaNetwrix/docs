__Step 2 –__ Select the source you need and configure its settings. See detailed instructions for the sources:

- [Box](box/addbox.md)
- [Add Single Database](database/addsingledatabase.md) (Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle database)
- [Dropbox](dropbox/adddropbox.md)
- [Exchange Server](exchangemailbox/exchangeserver.md) or [Exchange Mailbox](exchangemailbox/exchangemailbox.md)
- [File System](filesystem/overview.md) (includes Folder and File)
- [Google Drive Source](googledrive/addgdsource.md)
- [Outlook Mail Archive](exchangemailbox/outlookmailarchive.md)
- [SharePoint](sharepoint/overview.md) or [SharePoint Online](sharepoint/sharepointonline.md)

All your content sources will be listed in the __Sources__ section.

__NOTE:__ When adding a source or managing source configuration, the most commonly used source settings are displayed by default. However, some source types have additional configuration options that can be displayed by clicking the Advanced Settings ("wrench" icon). You can allow these advanced settings to be always shown to authorized users. [Users and Security Settings](../../security/users.md)
