# Reviewing SharePoint Dashboard

The SharePoint dashboard is similar to the main reporting dashboard, with the results filtered to SharePoint types. See [Operations and Health Dashboards](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/reporting/dashboards.md) for more information on the reporting dashboard.

To open the SharePoint dashboard:

1. In the main window, click __SharePoint__ tab.
2. Select __Dashboard__ on the left.

Here you can examine:

- __Index size__ diagram that shows index size for various entities (subsites, libraries, etc.)
- __Classification coverage__ diagram that identifies the percentage of content that has had classifications applied, and the percentage that has not.
