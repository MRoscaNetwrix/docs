# SharePoint Online

Office 365 customers can configure the collector service to automatically detect and queue their employees SharePoint Online sites hosted in Office 365. An account with Tenant administration rights must be supplied, and the frequency of the detection of new SharePoint Online sites must be set. It is also possible to provide a filter expression to ensure that certain SharePoint Online paths are included and others excluded as required.

Optionally, it is also possible to set up the resources necessary to ensure Netwrix Data Classification is enabled and configured on the detected SharePoint Online sites. Templating allows an administrator to pre-configure classification configurations for site collections. For more information please review the associated templating guide.
