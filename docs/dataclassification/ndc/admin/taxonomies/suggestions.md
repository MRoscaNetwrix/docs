Clues can be suggested for a term via the following methods:

- Suggest Clues for whole term: Click on the Suggest Clues for class link under the class heading to produce a list of suggestions, based on all existing clues in the class.
- Single Clue: Click on the Suggest link against each clue to produce a list of suggestions, based on only this clue.
- Class Document: Click on the Suggest link against each class document to produce a list of suggestions, based on the document.

Once the list of suggested clues has been generated they can be selected and added to the term clues:

__NOTE:__ Changes made to a class will have no effect unless documents are re-classified.

The clue type can be set to one of the following:

- Standard
- Case-Sensitive
- Phonetic
- Create Tree Node

__NOTE:__ If Create Tree Node is selected then these topics shall be added as children of the currently selected node in the taxonomy structure.
