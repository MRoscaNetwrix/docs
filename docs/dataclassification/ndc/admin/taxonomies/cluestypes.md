# Types of Clues

The following clue types of clues are available, each clue type is described in detail below.

## Standard Clues

A single word, multi-word concepts or phrases. Use quotes around standard clues to invoke a case-insensitive exact match on entered text, including any punctuation.

Examples:

A standard clue matched on a fuzzy basis with word stemming enabled: training will match against: train, training, trains.

A standard clue enclosed in double quotes will be matched on an exact match basis: "Train timetables in the U.K." will match only against: Train timetables in the U.K. (Case-insensitive)

## Case-Sensitive Clues

A case-sensitive phrase match clue, including any punctuation. There is no need to put double quotes around the text (double quotes at the start and/or end of the text will be removed).

## Phrasematch (Wildcard) Clues

A phrase match clue that supports the use of ‘\*’ and ‘?’ wildcards when matching document text (see Types of Cluessection for full REGEX support).

## Metadata Clues

A clue based on document metadata, with matching based on:

- Exact string matches – Such as: AUTHOR=JOHN SMITH
- Wildcard string matches – Such as: AUTHOR\*=john sm?th\*
- Full regex string matches – Such as: AUTHOR^=john.\*smith
- Date Range matches – Such as: FIELD > VALUE
- Dynamic Date Range matches – Such as: FIELD>TODAY OR FIELD>TODAY-14 (Matching the last 2 weeks)
- Integer Range matches – Such as FIELD > VALUE or FIELD

Helpers are provided to format metadata clues, to activate the helper simply select the appropriate icon for the desired clue type (numeric, date, and basic): ![metadatacluehelpers](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/metadatacluehelpers.webp)

The date helper supports assisting in the creation of both static and dynamic date clues:

![createdateclue](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/createdateclue.webp)

Both field and value are case-insensitive for metadata matches. Wildcard matches must included a \* character before the equals sign (as shown in the example above).

The following special metadata fields can be used:

- __CSE-CONTENTTYPE__- The raw content type

  For example:

  text/\*pdf

  application/pdf

  Most applications should use the CSE-TYPE field or the FILE TYPE field (see below) rather than the CSE-CONTENTTYPE field due to the highly variable nature of the raw values.

  Examples:

  A clue based on PDF documents would look like this: cse-type = application/pdf

  A clue based on a specific author would look like this: _author=john smith_

- __CSE-DOCTYPE__ - The DocType integer field

- __CSE-FILENAME__ - The document filename (e.g. “Pensions.doc”)
- __CSE-FILEPATH__ - The document path not including the filename (e.g. “http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/”)
- __CSE-FOLDERS__ - Used to match folders including sub-folders.

  For example:

  CSE-FOLDERS=http://www.abc.com/jobs/

  matches: http://www.abc.com/jobs/123.txt and also http://www.abc.com/jobs/UK/123.txt

  A clue based on a right truncated path would look like this:

  _CSE-FOLDERS=c:\myfolder\subfolder_ or _CSE-FOLDERS=http://www.abc.com/jobs/_

  Note that when using cse-Folders with a right-truncated path the path must always end with a slash character. A clue based on selected folders within the path would look like this: _CSE-FOLDERS=myfolder/myfolder2_

  Note that when using cse-Folders with subfolder matches the value must not begin or end with a slash character.
- __CSE-FOLDER__ - Used to match folders without including sub-folders.

  For example:

  _CSE-FOLDER=http://www.abc.com/jobs/_

  matches: http://www.abc.com/jobs/123.txt

  does not match: http://www.abc.com/jobs/UK/123.txt
- __CSE-LASTMODIFIEDDATE__ - The LastModifiedDate from the collected content in the format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS”.

  This field can only be matched using the greater than or less than operators, for example:

  _CSE-LASTMODIFIEDDATE CSE-LASTMODIFIEDDATE > 2010-01-01_

  Only the date can be specified, not the time.
- __CSE-LANG__ - The dominant language of the document, using ISO 639-1 two-letter codes. See Language Detection settings for more information.
- __CSE-METADATACOLLECTIONONLY__ - This value will be set to “1” if the document was too large for the NDC index (max 500MB), but was processed using metadata only.
- __CSE-PAGETITLE__ - The Title extracted from the document itself.
- __CSE-TEXTLENGTH__ - The length of the plain text extracted from the document, in characters. This field can only be matched using the equals, greater than or less than operators, for example:

  CSE-TEXTLENGTH = 50000

  CSE-TEXTLENGTH > 50000

  CSE-TEXTLENGTH
- __CSE-TITLE__ - The Title extracted from metadata.
- __CSE-URL__ - The document Url, including the filename (e.g. “http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/Pensions.doc”)
- __FILE TYPE__ - The short normalised content type, always one of the following:

  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | __Adobe PDF files__ | Corel WordPerfect files | Microsoft Excel files | Microsoft Outlook MSG files | Microsoft PowerPoint files | Microsoft Rich Text Format files | Microsoft Word files | Text files (including HTML, XML, CSV, etc.) |
  | PDF | WPD | XLS | MSG | PPT | RTF | DOC | TXT |
  |  |  | XLSX |  | PPTX |  | DOCX | HTML |
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | XML |
- __FILE SIZE__ - The length of the document, in bytes.

  This field can be matched using the equal, greater than or less than operators, for example:

  _FILE SIZE = 10000_

  _FILE SIZE_ _FILE SIZE > 10000_

  The Modified date from the document metadata in the format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS”. This field can be matched using the equal, greater than or less than operators, for example:

  _MODIFIED = 2010-01-01_

  _MODIFIED MODIFIED > 2010-01-01_

  Only the date can be specified, not the time.

## Phonetic Clues

A case-insensitive fuzzy/phonetic phrase match clue. Phonetic clues ignore all non-alphanumeric characters. Words that contain no digits are matched using a phonetic algorithm so that words that sound similar will be matched. Phonetic clues do not use word stemming in the matching process.

For example, the following clue:

Intelligence Organisations in the Middle East

Would match any of the following:

- Intelligence Organizations in the Middle East
- Intelligence Organisations in the Middle-East
- Inteligence organisations, in the “middle east”.

But not any of the following:

- Intelligence Organisations located in the Middle East
- Intelligence Organisations in the Mid-East

## Regex Clues

A Regular Expression matching clue – by default this is run across all document text and metadata. Regular expression clues are run in a case-sensitive manner by default. You can optionally enable the "Case-Insensitive Regex Processing" mode, this setting can be found in Config -> Classifier.

Definitions of the required syntax for regular expressions can be found in many places, including Microsoft: [Regular Expression Syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/ae5bf541(v=vs.100)).

The following example clue matches US Social Security Numbers found anywhere in the document text:

```[/,,/.,/=,\s]((?!000)[0-6]\d{2}|7[0-6]\d|77[0-2])-((?!00)\d{2})-((?!0000)\d{4})[/,,/.,\s]```

This sample clue ensures that:

- The SSN must consist of 11 characters in this format: NNN-NN-NNNN
- The SSN must be preceded by a white space or a dot or a comma or an equals sign.
- The SSN must be followed by a white space or a dot or a comma.
- The two hyphens must be present.
- None of the three sections can be equal to zero.
- The first section must be in the range 001 – 772

Any regular expression matches found will be extracted and added to the NDC index automatically. For example, if we have a document that contains this text:

Here is one SSN: 407-54-8831

And here is another 407-54-8832 in the middle of this sentence.

Then the following metadata entries will be generated automatically:

- Regex-SSN:407-54-8831
- Regex-SSN:407-54-8832

__NOTE:__ The example social security numbers above intentionally do not match the regular expression.

These can easily be viewed within the document “Info” popup on the “Metadata” tab (filtered to Regex values). The automatically generated metadata field name is a combination of the term name prefixed with “Regex-“.

##### Regular Expression Result Validation

In some cases it may be necessary to assign certain requirements on the result of the regular expression. This is particularly relevant for expressions that may include false positives such as social security numbers (simple pattern) or credit card numbers (sample data). The classification engine includes a number of post match validation steps:

- Exclusion Patterns—Provides the ability to exclude a match based upon an exclusion pattern (exclude sample data etc). Exclusion patterns can be added by selecting the “Exclusions” link. If any exclusion rule is matched the regular expression result will be discarded.

  __TIP:__ Hit count based regular expression clue exclusions — restrict whether a regular expression clue should match based upon the number of unique matches found against the regular expression. I.E, a regex to match any number against the text: "1 1 1 2 3 4" - has 4 hits, 4 unique numbers.
- Validation Checks—Regex validation checks provide a way of reducing false positives returned by your regular expression. You can define the following check types:

  - check-digit validations (suitable for credit card numbers, international bank account numbers etc),
  - simple pattern-based exclusions to remove test data and values that are not of interest,
  - minimum or maximum constraints on both the number of matches and the number of unique matches.

  Currently supported checks include: _Mod 97/10_, _Luhn_, _Verhoeff_

  _Remember,_ If any validation check fails, then the regular expression result will be discarded.

_Follow the steps to add a validation check._

1. Select the Validation Check link for the desired clue.
2. Click Add.
3. Select the desired check __Type__ from the drop-down list, and specify other settings depending on the type.

4. Click Save.

##### Proximity matches

Proximity matches enable you to include or exclude a RegEx match based on the presence of certain text before or after it.

For example, you might have a RegEx to look for driver’s license numbers, but you know that your documents include a lot of numbers with that pattern that aren’t actually driver’s license numbers.

Matches can be added by selecting the “Proximity Matches” link. Matches are processed as follows:

- If any ‘Exclude’ match passes then the regular expression result will be discarded
- If no ‘Include’ matches exist – or, at least one ‘Include’ match passes then the regular expression result will be considered valid
- Inclusion rules can now optionally apply a static boost to the score when they match. A boost will be applied for each matching inclusion rule.

__NOTE:__ This functionality is only available when utilising classification Engine v2. The additional settings are also not currently available in SharePoint Term Sets (but can be linked via Term Boosts).

Follow the steps to use __Proximity Match__ feature.

1. On the Content > Term Management > Regex Exc__lusions pa__ge, select Proximity Matches against the RegEx clue you need.
2. Select Add to add a proximity match.
3. On the Details tab, specify the required information:

- Pattern - text to be classified.
- Range type - type of information to be classified (words. numbers, etc.)
- Range - score range to be classified (50, by default). For example, 50 words at maximum.
- Options - Specify "Match before", "Match after", or "Exclude on match" for the pattern.
- Boost - In normal operation, the proximity feature acts as a boolean switch and if the proximity does not match then the entire clue fails to match. If you check the __Boost__ option then this changes. If the regex matches in the document, then it scores the base score, if the proximity match also matches then the base score is increased by the amount assigned to the boost. e.g. the base regex might score 40 and the boost might score an extra 10 making a total of 50 points. However if the regex matches but the boost does not, it will still score 40 points.

  __NOTE:__ This option applies directly to the term/clue and cannot be used for the Term Boost calculation.

## Required Terms clue

The Required Term clue type can be used to require another class to be classified as a pre-requisite for this class. This is most often used when the children of a class require the parent to also be classified.

The valid entries for this type of clue are:

- Parent
- Grandparent
- Any specific term in any taxonomy

A tree view control makes selecting the required class easy:

![requiredterm](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/requiredterm.webp)

For example, suppose that we have a topic _Pensions_ with two children:

- Pensions

  - USA
  - Canada

The purpose of the two child classes is to identify documents that are about pensions in the USA or about pensions in Canada. Rather than add clues to identify pensions documents to the children you can simply require documents to be about _Pensions_ by using a Required Class clue type.

## Term Boost Clues

You use the Term Boost clue type to specify that a Class Score is to be boosted from another term. This is most often used when a complex class is implemented using several child (or even grandchild) classes. Basically, you would want to apply these clues to refer to the other term or taxonomy and review the score for each term, not drilling down to each term. Review the example:

![termboostclue_int](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/termboostclue_int.webp)

In a tree view you can find the list of terms, which are displayed in the Term boost list to the right. This way you can review or edit the average score for each term.

Use the tree view control below to select boosting classes easy.

![termboost](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/termboost.webp)

The score may be entered as a number (if a fixed boost is required regardless of the source term’s score) or as a percentage (if the boost score is to be calculated as a percentage of the source term’s score).

When referencing a specific node it is also possible to include all of the levels of that nodes descendants at once.

![termboostclue_allterms](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/termboostclue_allterms.webp)

At classification time if the referenced node or any of its descendants (up to the configured level) reach their threshold then the term boost will be applied.

Select the Exclude Not Available for Tagging check box, if you want to exclude the terms, which are not available for tagging. This feature lets you select the grayed-out terms and exclude them for tagging for your taxonomy. For example, you have UK ZIP code, which was tagged as __Available for Tagging__ before. It doesn't qualify as sensitive for your Confidential term. Therefore, you can apply this feature.

## Language Clues

The language clue type can be used to require documents to be written primarily in a specified language as a filter on classification.

For example, if you create a new class and want documents to be classified only if they are written in a Scandinavian language then you would create a Language clue, like this:

![languageclue](/img/product_docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/taxonomies/languageclue.webp)

## Static Clues

The static clue applies a score to the class without any pre-conditions, this can be useful when creating NOT functionality.

For example:

If you want to classify any document where a word does NOT exist (such as _Pensions_), you could first add a static clue with a score of 50, and then add a standard clue looking for _Pensions_ with a negative score (-50).

## Hierarchical Clues

Hierarchical clues support a parent-child clue hierarchy, if the child clues achieve the parent clue threshold then the hierarchical score will be applied.

This can be useful when you only want to apply a score if two or more conditions to match, or perhaps to only apply a small static score if a word appears X times within a document.
