- Clue Counts—Provides a report of the number of clues per term, also includes a count of regular expression clues.
- __Hit Counts__— Provides a grouped summary of hit counts per taxonomy or class - identifying the numbers of times the regular expressions used for auto-classification have been identified within the indexed corpus.
