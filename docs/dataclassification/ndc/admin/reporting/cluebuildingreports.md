# Clue Building Reports

Review the list of the built-in clue building reports:

- __Auto Classification Review__— Provides a list of documents tagged with a given set of classifications. For full debugging detail, the trace mode "Classification Calculations" must be enabled prior to auto-classification.
- Classification Misses—Reports on documents that almost reached the threshold for classification, but ‘missed’ being classified by 20% or less. Supports filtering by URL and source group.
- Clue Coverage—Provides a report on the usage of clues within classification tagging. Assists in highlighting clues that are not aiding the classification process, or clues that are too vague. Supports filtering by URL and source group.
- __RegEx Performance__ - Provides a report on the usage of regular expressions and its performance during the search (call count, matches, max (ms), etc.). To activate the report, __RegEx Performance__ feature must be enabled in the __Configuration__ → __Core__ →  __System__.
