# Built-in Reports

Netwrix Data Classification offers a number of built-in reports and charts that refer to indexing and classification process and results, as well to the system operation. They can be run in browser, as well as exported to Excel or CSV files. [See Manage Reports for more information.](/docs/dataclassification/ndc/admin/reporting/manage.md)

__NOTE:__ For some reports, __Auto-classification change logging__ must be enabled to supply the reports with the required data.

To enable Auto-Classification change logging

1. In the management console, select __System Configuration__→__Config__→__Settings__→__System__→__Classifier__.
2. Select the __Auto-Classification Change Log__ option.
3. Click __Save__.
