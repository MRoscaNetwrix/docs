# Architecture

Identity ManagerÂ is built to work via a specific architecture made of a server, an agent and a database.

## Server, Agent and Database

Identity Manager works via:

* a server which operates computation, stores all applicative data in the database, and serves a web User Interface;
* at least one agent which operates data flows to/from the managed systems.

  :::note
The managed systems' credentials are used only by the agent and are never disclosed to the server.
  :::

The agent can call the server, but the server cannot call the agent. The data flows' initiatives are always from the agent.

## Installation Types

Identity Manager can be installed:

* SaaS so that the server dwells in the cloud and is provided as a service;

* on-premises so that the server is installed on an isolated network within the company.
