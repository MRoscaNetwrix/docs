# How to Implement a New System

How to add a new system to the solution.

## Overview

When connecting Identity ManagerÂ to a new system, several process paths can be taken according to your strategy. There is no option fundamentally better than the others, your decision must depend on your needs.

The **option A** leads quickly to the implementation in production environment, i.e. a new application in Identity Manager's scope. With this, you can [Review Orphaned and Unused Accounts](../../administrate/orphan-unused-account-review/index "Review Orphaned and Unused Accounts"), [Provision](../../administrate/provisioning/index "Provision") the AD, [Reconcile a Property](../../administrate/non-conforming-assignment-review/property-reconciliation/index "Reconcile a Property"), and [Generate Reports](../../administrate/reporting/index "Generate Reports"), for example the list of profiles assigned to users.

The **option B** takes more time as it goes through the creation of the role model based on the system's entitlements, but it leads to even more gain as you can also [Reconcile a Role](../../administrate/non-conforming-assignment-review/role-reconciliation/index "Reconcile a Role"), [Perform Access Certification](../../administrate/access-certification/index "Perform Access Certification")access certification and [Request Entitlement Assignment](../../administrate/manual-assignment-request/index "Request Entitlement Assignment"), and also [Generate Reports](../../administrate/reporting/index "Generate Reports"), for example the list of assigned single roles.

The option B is more complicated and time-consuming than the option A, but leads to more gain. Be aware that you can go through the process options simultaneously.

## Process Details

### Common starting steps

1. [Connect to a Managed System](../../set-up/connect-system/index "Connect to a Managed System"): create the appropriate connector with its connections and entity types.
2. [Synchronize Data](../../set-up/synchronization/index) into Identity Manager.

   Based on this, you can [Generate Reports](../../administrate/reporting/index "Generate Reports"), for example the list of resources in the system. A few predefined reports are available from the start, you can generate any report from this list as soon as it makes sense according to the integration progress.
3. [Categorize Resources](../../set-up/categorization/index) in order to classify them according to their intent, and correlate these resources with their owners.
4. [Create a Provisioning Rule](../../set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/index) to write to the system in order to update the resources' properties directly in the system.
5. Adjust the rules by [Reconcile a Property](../../administrate/non-conforming-assignment-review/property-reconciliation/index) resources, i.e. analyze the differences spotted between the reality of resources' properties and those computed by the previously established rules. Especially, verify that accounts are correlated to the right owners and that their properties have the right values.

   Either the integrator handles the customization of the rules and the review of non-conforming resources, or they can assign an application administrator profile to a given user to perform it. Assigning this profile requires profile configuration, see steps 11 and 12.

After connecting Identity Manager to an external system, two process options are available according to your needs: either aim directly to the implementation in production environment, or first build the role model in order to enable more administration activities. Both options can be started simultaneously.

### Option A: Straight to production implementation

Go directly to the common final steps (step 8).

### Option B: First build the role model

6. [Create Roles in the Role Catalog](../../set-up/single-roles-catalog-creation/index "Create Roles in the Role Catalog") for applications managed by the system.
7. [Automate Assignments](../../optimize/assignment-automation/index "Automate Assignments") if needed: use Role Mining to create single role rules in bulk; adjust the generated rules individually and manually.

### Common final steps

8. Perform tests.
9. Deploy the pre-production configuration to the production environment.
