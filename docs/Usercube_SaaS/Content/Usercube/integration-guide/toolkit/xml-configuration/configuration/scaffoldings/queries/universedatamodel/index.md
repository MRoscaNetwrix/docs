# Universe Data Model

This scaffolding creates, within a universe, entity instances and association instances based on a predefined template.

The entity instances generated by the scaffolding will have:

* as a display name, the display name of the corresponding navigation property, for example `Main Record`;
* as an identifier, the identifier of the corresponding navigation which is made of `_`, for example `Directory_User_MainRecord`.

## Properties

| Property | Details |
| --- | --- |
| EntityType required | **Type**  String  **Description** Identifier of the entity type that we want to represent in the universe (as an entity instance) with all its navigations. |
| Universe required | **Type**  String  **Description** Identifier of the universe in which the instances to be generated are going to exist. |

## Child Elements

* Excluded Property (optional) to ignore a given property of the specified entity type.
* Root Instance (optional) to rename the core entity instance that is to be generated, and to avoid data duplication when using several scaffoldings in one universe.
* Source Entity Type (optional) Define the source EntityType
* Universe Template (optional) to use a template different from the default one.

### Excluded Property

| Property | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Property required | **Type**  String  **Description** Property of the specified entity type that is to be ignored for the generation of entity instances and association instances. |

A scaffolding does not use filters, but a part of the entity model can be excluded with the `ExcludedProperty` argument.

The following example generates a universe `U8_Users` based on the entity type `Directory_User`, like our U1 but without the `Guests` property:

```

    


```
When getting Identity Manager data in [Connect Power BI to Identity Manager](../../../../../../governance/reporting/how-tos/connect-powerbi/index), we see the following:

![Universe (ExcludedProperty)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_excluded.png)

### Root Instance

| Property | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Instance required | **Type**  String  **Description** Identifier of the entity instance generated based on the EntityType property of the universe scaffolding. If not specified, the identifier of the entity instance is the identifier of the entity type. |

The following example generates a universe `U2_UserRecords` based on the entity type `Directory_UserRecord`, naming the entity instance `REC`:

```

    


```
![Universe (RootInstance)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_rootInstance.png)

When getting Identity Manager data in [Connect Power BI to Identity Manager](../../../../../../governance/reporting/how-tos/connect-powerbi/index), we see the following:

![Universe (RootInstance)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_rootInstance.png)

#### RootInstance for several scaffoldings together

A universe can be made of several scaffoldings which need to be grouped together a specific way. One universe made of two scaffoldings will generate the two entity instances corresponding to the two specified entity types, with the entity and association instances corresponding to their navigation properties. To avoid data duplication in the universe model, we use `RootInstance` to rename one of the entity instances and follow the existing naming rule explained in the introduction.

**The following example** generates a universe `U3_UserRecords` based on the entity types `Directory_User` and `Directory_UserRecord` (without `RootInstance`):

```


```
![Universe Schema (Several Scaffoldings with Data Duplication)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_severalDuplicationSchema.png)

When getting Identity Manager [data in Power BI](../../../../../../governance/reporting/how-tos/connect-powerbi/index), we see the following:

![Universe (Several Scaffoldings with Data Duplication)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_severalDuplication.png)

We see that `Directory_User_Records` and `Directory_UserRecords` represent the same entity instances.

**The following example** generates a better version of the universe `U3_UserRecords` based on the entity types `Directory_User` and `Directory_UserRecord`, renaming `Directory_UserRecord` as `Directory_User_Records` to follow the naming rule, thus building the universe model with `Directory_User` as the core entity instance:

```

    


```
![Universe (Several Scaffoldings without Data Duplication)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_severalNoDuplicationSchema.png)

When getting Identity Managerdata in [Connect Power BI to Identity Manager](../../../../../../governance/reporting/how-tos/connect-powerbi/index), we see the following:

![Universe (Several Scaffoldings without Data Duplication)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_severalNoDuplication.png)

Thus we removed the duplicated data, and we understand easily the navigations of the model.

### Source Entity Type

| Property | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Identifier optional | **Type** String  **Description** The identifier's SourceEntityType |

### Universe Template

| Property | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Template required | **Type** String  **Description** Represents the argument value. |

#### Default Template

When no template is specified, the scaffolding generates:

* an entity instance based on a given entity type;
* an association instance and an entity instance for each navigation property of the entity type.

**The following example** generates a universe `U1_Users` based on the entity type `Directory_User`:

```



```
It generates:

```


  One entity instance for the entity type Directory_User:
  

  One association instance and one entity instance per navigation property:
      ...



```
![Universe (No Template)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_noTemplateSchema.png)

When getting Identity Manager data in [Connect Power BI to Identity Manager](../../../../../../governance/reporting/how-tos/connect-powerbi/index), we see the following:

![Universe (No Template)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_noTemplate.png)

We see here identifiers instead of display names due to `ColumnNamesMode` set to identifiers.

#### Owned Resource Types

The following example generates a universe `U4_User` based on the entity type `Directory_User` and the resources assigned to users:

```

    


```
It generates:

```


  One entity instance for the entity type Directory_User.
  

  Association instances and entity instances about the AD_Entry_NominativeUser resource type:

        

  Same for all resource types.
  ...



```

When getting Identity Manager data in [Connect Power BI to Identity Manager](../../../../../../governance/reporting/how-tos/connect-powerbi/index), we see the following:

![Universe (Template: Owned Resource Types)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_OwnedResourceTypes.png)

#### ResourceResourceTypes

The following example generates a universe `U5_AD` based on the entity type `AD_Entry` and the owners of AD resources:

```

    


```
The configuration generated by this snippet is similar to the one for `OwnedResourceTypes`.

#### Owned Single Roles

The following example generates a universe `U6_User` based on the entity type `Directory_User` and the single roles assigned to users:

```

    


```
It generates:

```


  One entity instance for the entity type Directory_User.
  

  One entity instance containing data about role assignments, and one association instance linking it to Directory_User:
    

  One entity instance containing the single roles, and one association instance linking it to the role assignment data:
    

```

![Universe (Template: Owned Single Roles)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_OwnedSingleRoles.png)

#### Owned Composite Roles

The following example generates a universe `U7_User` based on the entity type `Directory_User` and the composite roles assigned to users:

```

    


```
The configuration generated by this snippet is similar to the one for `OwnedSingleRoles`.

![Universe (Template Schema: Owned Composite Roles)](../../../../../../../../../../../static/images/Usercube_SaaS/Content/Resources/Images/Universe_OwnedCompositeRolesSchema.png)

## Mixed Example

Scaffoldings can be adjusted with [universe configuration](../../../../business-intelligence/index).

The following example generates a universe `U9_AccessControl` aiming to create reports displaying users and their profiles. In our situation, profiles are assigned to AD accounts based on a given context. This is why we base our universe on the entity types `AD_Entry`, `AssignedProfile` and `ProfileContext`. Plus, there are 10 dimensions in contexts, but only dimensions 0 and 1 are used, so we exclude the others. We exclude also resource types and single roles that are of no use for us here.

```
                                                                

```
When getting Identity Manager data in [Connect Power BI to Identity Manager](../../../../../../governance/reporting/how-tos/connect-powerbi/index), we see the following:
