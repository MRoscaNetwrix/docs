## Properties

| Property | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Binding required | **Type**  String  **Description** Binding whose difference with `ExpressionBinding` defines the property to be validated by the aspect. |
| Identifier required | **Type**  String  **Description** Unique identifier of the aspect. |
| ExpressionBinding optional | **Type**  String  **Description** Binding: - that defines the variable type used in the potential expressions specified in the aspect; - whose difference with `Binding` defines the property involved in the aspect.  **Note:** required when handling the property of multi-valued objects, for example records, to make sure to modify the property in all records and not only in one. |
| IfExpression optional | **Type**  String  **Description** Expression that conditions the aspect execution. See the [Expressions](../../../../expressions/index "Expressions") topic for additional information. |
| Message\_L1 optional | **Type**  String  **Description** Message in language 1 (up to 16) to be displayed when the property is empty. |
| Priority default value: 0 | **Type**  Int32  **Description** Execution priority among all aspects. At a given activity state, the aspect with the highest priority will be triggered first.  **Note:** the priority can be a negative value. |

## Child Element: PointCut

A pointcut is a mechanism telling Identity ManagerÂ when to execute the linked [Aspects](../index).

The position of the pointcut is specified by an activity state and a mode (before or after).
