```
./Usercube-Login.exe

```
The following example launches the authentication to a specific Identity Provider whose authentication URL and Client Id are respectively `https://my_oidc_authentication_server.com` and `34b3c-fb45da-3ed32`.

```
The following example launches the authentication to Identity Manager's Identity Provider, but using a specific port `5050`. It will open your default browser to `http://localhost:5050` where you will be redirected to Identity Manager's IDP. that will provide you with the authentication token.
