# Jobs with Errors

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when a job ends with an error. The notification email is sent to the user who has the necessary rights and the permission.

See the [Native Notifications](../index "Native Notifications") and [Profiles & Permissions](../../../profiles-permissions/index "Profiles & Permissions") topics for additional information.
