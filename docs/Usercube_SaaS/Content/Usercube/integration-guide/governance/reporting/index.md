# Reporting

The Reporting module is used to generate basic reports in CSV using [API query grammar](../../api/squery/index), or advanced reports using the [Business Intelligence](../../toolkit/xml-configuration/business-intelligence/index) module.

See the [Generate Reports](../../../user-guide/administrate/reporting/index) topic for additional information on generating reports.
