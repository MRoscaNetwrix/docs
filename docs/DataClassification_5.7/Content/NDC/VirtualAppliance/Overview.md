# Virtual Deployment

In addition to traditional on-premises deployment, Netwrix Data Classification now offers new deployment options that can speed time-to-value by getting you up and running in less than 15 minutes.

Virtual appliance â€” If you run a Microsoft Hyper-V or VMware vSphere, you can deploy Netwrix Data Classification as a virtual appliance. Virtual appliance is a VM image file with installed Netwrix Data Classification. The image is also configured to use Microsoft Edge as a default web browser.
