# Reporting Capabilities

Selecting **Analysis** → Reports in the management console helps a user extract a wealth of information from the NDC index.

The main **Dashboard** has three high level graphs highlighting the current state of processing:

* Document Progress—A graphical display of the main stats display, once processing is complete documents will be allocated to either Fully Processed or Errors
* Index Size—Shows the percentage of each source type being processed
* Classification Coverage—Shows the percentage of classified content, broken down by type, and the percentage of content that has not received any auto-classifications

It is possible to filter and refine data presentation to look for the areas that contain the largest amount of documents tagged with a particular term, or to only review specific content.

Reporting capabilities also include the following:

* [Content Distribution Map](ContentDistributionMap)
* [Built-in Reports](BuiltinReportsOverview "Built-in Reports")
