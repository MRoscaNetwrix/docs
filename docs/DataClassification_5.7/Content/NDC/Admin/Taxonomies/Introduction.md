## What are Taxonomies?

Netwrix Data Classification comes with several built-in **taxonomies** with hundreds of classification rules out-of-the-box. The taxonomies cover a broad range of sensitive personal, financial, and health-related information. Each taxonomy contains a set of terms. **Terms** are defined by set of configuration **rules** (also called **clues**). See [Classification Rules (Clues)](Clues) for details.

* To create a taxonomy, go to the **Taxonomies** area of the web-based management console and follow the procedures described in [Add a Taxonomy](Add) section.
* To manage the taxonomies, follow the procedures described in [Manage Taxonomies](Manage) section.

**IMPORTANT!** To access the **Taxonomies** area, users require sufficient rights. See the [User Management](../../Security/UserManagement) section for more information.
