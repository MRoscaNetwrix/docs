This will show the classification calculation using the latest clues definition.

There are three sections:

* Clues – Shows how each clue contributed to the total score.
* Boosts – Shows what boosts were added to the clue scores when related terms were processed (e.g. Parent and Child terms).

* Related—Shows a flat list of terms that were linked by "Boosts" (including chained links). Selecting a term will alter the display to show the corresponding clues / boosts / filters for the linked term.
