# Reports with Video

Netwrix Auditor can be configured to capture video of user activity on the monitored computers that helps analyze and control changes made there. When you click a link, a video player opens and playback of the recorded user activity starts, showing launched applications, actions, etc.

To view reports with video, navigate to Reports → User Activity.

In the report filters, select a monitoring plan you want to generate a report for. To review data sources and items included in each plan, navigate to the Monitoring Plans section.
