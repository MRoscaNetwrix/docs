These are reports on the SQL Server state-in-time data, including roles, permissions and other configuration settings:

- [Account Permissions in SQL

- [Object Permissions in SQL
  Server](sqlobjectpermissions.md)
- [SQL Server Databases](sqldatabases.md)

To instruct Netwrix Auditor to collect data needed for these reports, make sure that __Collect data for state-in-time reports__ option is selected in the corresponding monitoring plan properties. See theÂ [Settings for Data Collection](../../../monitoringplans/create.md#settings-for-data-collection) topic for additional information. By default, data collection will run daily at 4 AM.
