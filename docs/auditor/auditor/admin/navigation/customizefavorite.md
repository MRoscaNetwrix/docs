| _Favorites Sub-Folder Options_ | _Favorites > [Report] Options_ |
| Option Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Restore Default | Repopulates the Favorites sub-folder with all reports that have been marked Favorite.  When using Role-Based Access in Netwrix Auditor, if several users mark the same report as __Favorite__, then that report will be removed from the Favorites list if a user removes the report from the Favorites list. Using the __Restore Default__ option will re-add the report to the Favorites list for all users that have not removed the Favorite mark. |
| Refresh | Runs the reports in the Favorites folder to display the most recent information. |
| View | Opens the Preview Report page. There, you can modify report options (such as the timeframe) if desired, and then click View Report to see the resulting report. See the [View Reports](/docs/product_docs/auditor/auditor/admin/reports/view.md) topic for additional information. |
| Subscribe | Opens the Add Subscription to Report page. See the [Create Subscriptions](/docs/product_docs/auditor/auditor/admin/subscriptions/create.md) topic for additional information. |
| Add to Favorites | This option is greyed out when viewing the Favorites list, since all the reports shown have already been added to Favorites. |
| Remove from Favorites | Removes a report from the Favorites list.  This option provides the same function as removing a report as a favorite using the __Star__ icon. |
| Go to Original | Expands the sub-folder in which the report is originally located. For example, clicking __Go to Original__ for the Enterprise Overview report will expand the __Predefined > Organization Level Reports__ sub-folder. |
