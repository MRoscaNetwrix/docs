# Configure Cisco Meraki Devices

To configure Cisco Meraki devices, configure the Syslog server for each of your networks.

Netwrix recommends assigning a unique identificator to each Cisco Meraki device; otherwise, the product may count them as a single anonymous device.

Follow the steps to configure the Syslog server.

__Step 1 窶点_ Sign in to [Cisco Meraki Dashboard](https://account.meraki.com/secure/login/dashboard_login).

__Step 2 窶点_ Navigate to __Network wide__ > __Configure__ > __General__.
