# Create User Account to Access Nutanix REST API

To create a user account using the ncli utility:

1. Download and install the _ncli_ (Nutanix command-line interface) on any server in your infrastructure, as described [here](https://portal.nutanix.com/#here).
2. Start the utility and establish a _ncli_ session by the following command:

    ```ncli -s management_ip_addr -u 'username' -p 'user_password'```

   here:

   - ```management_ip_addr``` - the IP address of any Nutanix Controller VM in the cluster
   - ```username``` - user name to access that VM; if not specified, _admin_ (default name) will be used
   - ```user_password``` - password to access that VM
3. Run the ```fs list``` command in _ncli_ to get the list of Nutanix Files servers.
4. Locate the name of Nutanix Files server you want to audit; locate and save the following server parameters to a text file:
   - __Uuid__ - Nutanix Files server ID
5. Finally, create a new user and specify credentials that will be used to access this Nutanix Files server. For that, run the following command in _ncli_ :

    ```fs add-user uuid=<fs_uuid> user=<username> password=<password>```

   here:

   - ```<fs_uuid>``` - Nutanix Files server ID (Uuid)
   - ```<username>``` - user name
   - ```<password>``` - password
