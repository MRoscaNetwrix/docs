# Work with Collected Data

To leverage data collected with the add-on, you can do the following in Auditor:

- Search for required data. For that, start Auditor client and navigate to __Search__. After specifying the criteria you need, click __Search__. You will get a list of activity records with detailed information on who did what in the reported time period.

You can apply a filter to narrow down your search results to the Netwrix __API__ data source only.

- Also, you can click __Tools__ in the upper-right corner and select the command you need. For example:
  - If you want to periodically receive the report on the results of search with the specified criteria, click __Subscribe__. Then specify how you want the report to be delivered â€“ as an email or as a file stored to the file share.
  - To create an alert on the specific occurrences, click __Create alert__.
  - To export filtered data to PDF or CSV, click __Export data__.
- You can also configure and receive alerts on the events you are interested in.
