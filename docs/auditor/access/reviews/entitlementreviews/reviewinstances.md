# Review Instances

After a review has been completed, it can be run again, which creates multiple instances of the
review. Each instance is identified by date timestamps indicating its start and end times.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** Prior to running another review instance, ensure the most up to date information
is available to owners for review.

On the Manage Reviews page in the Entitlement Reviews interface, a review with a Completed status
can be started again. Select the review and click **Run Again**. The Create Review wizard opens
without the Review Type page. The review can be run as-is by navigating through the wizard with the
**Next** buttons, or you can modify as desired. Completing the wizard process restarts the review.
See the [Create Review Wizard](wizard/create.md) topic for additional information.
