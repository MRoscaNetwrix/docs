# Adjust Active Directory Tombstone Lifetime (optional)

You can restore deleted Active Directory objects and their attributes using the Netwrix Auditor
Object Restore for Active Directory tool shipped with Netwrix Auditor. The tool finds the
information on deleted objects in the product snapshots (this data is stored in the Long-Term
Archive, a local file-based storage of audit data) and AD tombstones.

To be able to restore deleted Active Directory objects longer, increase the **Active Directory
tombstone lifetime** property (set by default to 180 days). Netwrix recommends setting it to 2 years
(**730 days**). You can specify any number of days, but a selected value should not exceed the
Long-Term Archive retention period.

Take into consideration that increasing tombstone lifetime may affect Active Directory performance
and operability.

To change the tombstone lifetime attribute

To perform this procedure, you will need the
[ADSI Edit](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc773354(v=ws.10).aspx) utility. In Windows
Server 2008 and above, this component is installed together with the AD DS role, or it can be
downloaded and installed along with Remote Server Administration Tools. See the topic for additional
information on how to install the ADSIÂ Edit utility.

1. On any domain controller in the target domain, navigate to Start > Windows Administrative Tools >
   **ADSI Edit**.
2. Right-click the **ADSI Edit** node and select **Connect To**. In the **Connection Settings**
   dialog, enable **Select a well-known Naming Context** and select **Configuration** from the
   drop-down list.
