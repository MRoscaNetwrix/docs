# Object Restore for Active Directory

With Netwrix Auditor you can quickly restore deleted and modified objects using the Netwrix Auditor
Object Restore for Active Directory tool shipped with the product. This tool enables AD object
restore without rebooting a domain controller and affecting the rest of the AD structure, and goes
beyond the standard tombstone capabilities. Perform the following procedures:

- [Modify Schema Container Settings](#modify-schema-container-settings)
- [Roll Back Unwanted Changes](#roll-back-unwanted-changes)

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2008

## Modify Schema Container Settings

By default, when a user or computer account is deleted from Active Directory, its password is
discarded as well as a domain membership. When you restore deleted accounts with the Netwrix Auditor
Object Restore for Active Directory tool, it rolls back a membership in domain and sets random
passwords which then have to be changed manually. If you want to be able to restore AD objects with
their passwords preserved, you must modify the Schema container settings so that account passwords
are retained when accounts are being deleted.

To modify schema container settings

To perform this procedure, you will need the
[ADSI Edit](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc773354(v=ws.10).aspx) utility. In Windows
Server 2008 and above, this component is installed together with the AD DS role, or it can be
downloaded and installed along with Remote Server Administration Tools. See the topic for additional
information on how to install the ADSI Edit utility.

1. Navigate to Start > Windows Administrative Tools→ ADSI Edit.
2. Right-click the **ADSI Edit** node and select **Connect To**. In the **Connection Settings**
   dialog, enable **Select a well-known Naming Context** and select **Schema** from the drop-down
   list.
3. Expand the Schema your_Root_Domain_name node. Right-click the CN=Unicode-Pwd attribute and select
   Properties.

4. Double-click the searchFlags attribute and set its value to _"8"_.

Now you will be able to restore deleted accounts with their passwords preserved.

## Roll Back Unwanted Changes

1. Navigate to Start →Netwrix Auditor→Netwrix Auditor Object Restore for Active Directory.
2. On the Select Rollback Period step, specify the period of time when the changes that you want to
   revert occurred. You can either select a period between a specified date and the present date, or
   between two specified dates.
3. On the Select Rollback Source step, specify the rollback source. The following restore options
   are available:

    - State-in-time snapshots—This option allows restoring objects from configuration snapshots made
      by Netwrix Auditor. This option is more preferable since it allows to restore AD objects with
      all their attributes.

        Complete the following fields:

        | Option                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
        | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | Audited domain                  | Select a domain where changes that you want to rollback occurred.                                                                                                            |
        | Select a state-in-time snapshot | Select if you want to revert to a specific snapshot. Otherwise, the program will automatically search for the most recent snapshot that will cover the selected time period. |

    - Active Directory tombstones—This option is recommended when no snapshot is available. This is
      a last resort measure as the tombstone holds only the basic object attributes.

4. On the Analyzing Changes step, the product analyzes the changes made during the specified time
   period. When reverting to a snapshot, the tool reviews the changes that occurred between the
   specified snapshots. When restoring from a tombstone, the tool reviews all AD objects put in the
   tombstone during the specified period of time.
5. On the Rollback Results step, the analysis results are displayed. Select a change to see its
   rollback details in the bottom of the window. Select an attribute and click Details to see what
   changes will be applied if this attribute is selected for rollback. Check the changes you want to
   roll back to their previous state.
6. Wait until the tool has finished restoring the selected objects. On the last step, review the
   results and click Finish to exit the wizard.
