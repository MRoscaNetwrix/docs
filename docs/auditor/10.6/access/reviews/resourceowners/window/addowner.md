# Add Owner Window

The Add Owner window opens from either the
[Add New Resource Wizard](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/resourceowners/wizard/add.md)
of the
[Update Resource Wizard](/docs/auditor/10.6/access/reviews/resourceowners/wizard/update.md).
This window is used to search for a user account by browsing Active Directory.

Enter a name in the search field to find and select users from Active Directory, which populates in
a drop-down menu as you type. If multiple domains are known to the application, ensure the correct
domain is selected from the drop-down menu. Click **OK** and the Add Owner window closes. The
selected user appears in the Owner list.
