# Configuring Trace Logging

If trace logging is disabled in SQL Server, then changes will be reported in Netwrix Auditor as made
by _system_. To detect actual change initiator, Netwrix Auditor needs native trace logs data. During
every data collection, Netwrix Auditor will check if the internal SQL audit mechanism is enabled,
and enable it if necessary. To read more, refer to
[this Netwrix Knowledge Base article](https://kb.netwrix.com/728).

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html)
knowledge base article for additional information.

In some cases, however, you may need to disable trace logging on your SQL Server instance. For that,
follow the procedure below.

If you enable monitoring of SQL logons, SQL trace for these logons will be created anyway.

Follow the steps to exclude SQL Server instance from turning trace logging on automatically.

**Step 1 –** On Netwrix Auditor server, go to the _%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\SQL Server
Auditing_ folder.

**Step 2 –** Locate the _omittracelist.txt_ file and open it for editing.

**Step 3 –** Specify SQL Server instances that you want to exclude from switching trace logging on
automatically. Syntax: `server\instance name`

Each entry must be a separate line. Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and
will be ignored.

With trace logging disabled, the "Who", "Workstation" and "When" values will be not reported
correctly by Netwrix Auditor (except for content changes).

By default, SQL Server trace logs will be stored in the predefined location (depending on the SQL
Server version). For example, SQL Server 2019 error logs are located at _`<drive>`:\Program
Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.`<InstanceName>`\MSSQL\Log_.

You can change this default location, using the _pathstotracelogs.txt_ file.

Follow the steps to change trace log location.

**Step 1 –** On Netwrix Auditor server, go to _%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\SQL Server
Auditing_ folder.

**Step 2 –** Locate the _pathstotracelogs.txt_ file and open it for editing.

**Step 3 –** Specify SQL Server instance that you need to audit and enter a UNC path to the folder
where you want the trace logs to be stored. Syntax: `SQLServer\Instance|UNC path`

Each entry must be a separate line. Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and
will be ignored.

**Example:**

`SQLSRV01\MSSQL2016|C:\Logs\NA trace logs\`

If you want to change trace logs location for multiple instances of one SQL server, make sure that
specified UNC paths are unique across these instances.

Correct:

`SQLSRV01\MSSQL2014|C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL\LOG\`

`SQLSRV01\MSSQL2019|C:\Logs\SQL trace logs\`

Incorrect:

`SQLSRV01\MSSQL2014|C:\Logs\SQL trace logs\`

`SQLSRV01\MSSQL2019|C:\Logs\SQL trace logs\`

# SQL Server

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling
certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data
integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See
the
[Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html)
knowledge base article for additional information.

The IT Infrastructure for monitoring is configured automatically. Your current audit settings will
be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.

## Checking for Primary Key

If you plan to audit an SQL Server for data changes and browse the results using '_Before_' and
'_After_' filter values, make sure that the audited SQL database tables have a primary key (or a
unique column). Otherwise, '_Before_' and '_After_' values will not be reported.

## SQL Server Objects

Review a full list of all object and data types Netwrix Auditor can collect on SQL Server.

Monitored Object Types

The table below contains the full list of object types that Netwrix Auditor monitors on SQL Servers.
The product reports on adding and removing of object types below (Application Roles, Database, Jobs,
etc.) and modifying attributes of these objects (listed in the "_Attributes_" column).

As for logons, the product collects successful and failed logon attempts for Windows and SQL logons:

| Logon Type    | Action                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| SQL logon     | - Successful logon - Failed logon |
| Windows logon | - Successful logon - Failed logon |

Review the full list of monitored object types and their attributes:

The attributes marked with asterisk (\*) are reported only for the SQL Server item, not for
availability groups.

| Object type       | Attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Next Steps

Also remember to do the following:

- Configure Data Collecting Account as described in
  [Permissions for SQL Server Auditing ](/docs/auditor/10.6/data-sources/databases/sql-server.md)section.
- Configure ports as described in the
  [SQL Server Ports](/docs/auditor/10.6/reference/ports-and-protocols.md) section.

# Permissions for SQL Server Auditing

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit your SQL Server, plan for the account that will
be used for data collection – it should meet the requirements listed below. Then you will provide
this account in the monitoring plan wizard.

Starting with version 9.96, you can use group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) as data collecting
accounts.

**On the target SQL Server:**

1. To access SQL Server, Windows authentication will be used, so data collection account should be a
   Windows account specified in the _domain\user_ format (_domain\user$_ for Managed Service
   Account).  
   SQL Server logins and authentication method are not supported.
2. The account must be assigned the **System Administrator** server role for this SQL Server. See
   [Assigning 'System Administrator' Role](#assigning-system-administrator-role) section for more
   information.
3. For auditing SQL Server availability on groups, the account must have the sysadmin server role
   granted on each server added to an availability group.
4. If you plan to collect state-in-time data from SQL Server, in addition to requirements above the
   account will also need:
   - Local **Administrator** rights on the target SQL Server.
   - If SQL Server is included in the Active Directory domain, the account should also be included
     in that domain.

## Assigning 'System Administrator' Role

1. On the computer where audited SQL Server instance is installed, navigate to **Start → All
   Programs → Microsoft SQL Server → SQL Server Management Studio**.
2. Connect to the SQL Server instance.
3. In the left pane, expand the **Security** node. Right-click the **Logins** node and select **New
   Login** from the pop-up menu.

   ![manualconfig_ssms_newlogin2016](/img/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/auditor/configuration/sqlserver/manualconfig_ssms_newlogin2016.webp)

4. Click **Search** next to **Login Name** and specify the user that you want to assign the
   **sysadmin** role to.
5. Specify the **Server roles** tab and assign the **sysadmin** role to the new login.
