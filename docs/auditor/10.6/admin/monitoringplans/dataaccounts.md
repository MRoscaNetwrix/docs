# Data Collecting Account

This is a service account that Auditor uses to collect audit data from the monitored items (domains,
OUs, servers, etc.). Netwrix recommends creating a dedicated service account for that purpose.
Depending on the data source your monitoring plan will process, the account must meet the
corresponding requirements (see the table below).

If you are going to enable integration with Netwrix Data Classification (NDC Provider), additional
server roles must be assigned to the account. See
[Sensitive Data Discovery ](/docs/auditor/10.6/admin/settings/sensitivedatadiscovery.md)
topic for additional information.

Starting with version 9.96, you can use group Managed Service Account (gMSA) as data collecting
account. Currently, the following data sources are supported: Active Directory (also for Group
Policy and Logon Activity), Windows Server, File Server (currently for Windows File Servers), SQL
Server, SharePoint.

For more details about gMSA usage, see the
[Use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)](/docs/auditor/10.6/requirements/gmsa.md)topic
for additional information.

The gMSA should also meet the related requirements (see the table below).
