# Activity Summary Email

Activity Summary email is generated automatically by Netwrix Auditor and lists all changes /
recorded user sessions that occurred since the last Activity Summary delivery. By default, for most
data sources an Activity Summary is generated daily at 3:00 AM and delivered to the specified
recipients. You can also launch data collection and Activity Summary generation manually.

Notifications on user activity and event log collection (Event Log Collection Status) are a bit
different and do not show changes.

The following Activity Summary example applies to Active Directory. Other Activity Summaries
generated and delivered by Netwrix Auditor will vary slightly depending on the data source.
