# Manage Data Sources

You can fine-tune data collection for each data source. Settings that you configure for the data
source will be applied to all items belonging to that data source. Using data source settings, you
can, for example:

- Enable state-in-time data collection (currently supported for several data sources)
- Depending on the data source, customize the monitoring scope (e.g., enable read access auditing,
  monitoring of failed attempts)

To add, modify and remove data sources, enable or disable monitoring, you must be assigned the
Global administrator role in the product or the Configurator role on the plan. See the
[Role-Based Access and Delegation](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/delegation-and-permissions.md) topic for additional information.

## Modify Data Source Settings

Follow the steps to modify data source settings.

**Step 1 –** Select the monitoring plan you need and click **Edit**.

**Step 2 –** Within the monitoring plan window, highlight the data source (the first one is the row
right under the blue table header) and click Edit data source on the right:

**Step 3 –** Modify data source settings as you need.

**Step 4 –** When finished, click **Save**.

Also, you can add a data source to the monitoring plan, or remove a data source that is no longer
needed.

## Add a Data Source to an Existing Plan

Follow the steps to add a data source to existing plan.

**Step 1 –** Select the monitoring plan you need and click Edit.

**Step 2 –** In the right pane, select Add data source.

**Step 3 –** Specify a data source.

**Step 4 –** Configure settings specific to your data source.

**Step 5 –** When finished, click the **Add** button to save the settings.

## Add Items for Monitoring

Once you completed monitoring plan wizard and specified data sources, add items for monitoring. You
can add as many items for a data source as you want. In this case, all items will share settings you
specified for this data source.

Each data source has a dedicated item type. Netwrix Auditor automatically suggests item types
associated with your data source.

To add, modify and remove items, you must be assigned the Global administrator role in the product
or the **Configurator** role on the plan. See the
[Role-Based Access and Delegation](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/delegation-and-permissions.md)topic for additional information.

Follow the steps to add a new item to a data source:

**Step 6 –** Navigate to your plan settings.

**Step 7 –** Click Add item under the data source.

**Step 8 –** Provide the object name and configure item settings.

You can fine-tune data collection for each item individually. To do it, select an item within your
monitoring plan and click Edit item. For each item, you can:

- Specify a custom account for data collection
- Customize settings specific your item (e.g., specify SharePoint site collections)

## Configure Monitoring Scope

In some environments, it may not be necessary to monitor the entire IT infrastructure. Netwrix
monitoring scope can be configured on the Data Source and/or Item levels. the section below contains
examples on how to use omit functionality in Auditor.

In addition to the restrictions for a monitoring plan, you can use the \*.txt files to collect more
granular audit data. Note that the new monitoring scope restrictions apply together with previous
exclusion settings configured in the \*.txt files. See the [Monitoring Plans](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/index.md)topic for
additional information.

# Monitoring Plans

**NOTE:** Prior to configuring your monitoring plan, please read and complete the instructions in
the following topics:

- [Protocols and Ports Required](/docs/auditor/10.7/installation-and-setup/system-requirements/ports-and-networking.md) – To ensure successful data collection
  and activity monitoring configure necessary protocols and ports for inbound and outbound
  connections
- [Data Collecting Account](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/data-collection-accounts.md) – Configure data collecting accounts as required to
  audit your IT systems

- [Supported Data Sources](/docs/auditor/10.7/installation-and-setup/system-requirements/supported-data-sources.md) – Configure data source as
  required to be monitored

To start auditing your environment and analyzing user behavior with Netwrix Auditor, create a
monitoring plan.

A monitoring plan defines data collection, notification, and storage settings.

To start collecting data, and add items to its scope.

Follow the steps to collect data from your environment.

**Step 1 –** Create a monitoring plan with the wizard. Select the data source when you start the
monitoring plan wizard, and its initial settings are configured at the wizard steps. See the
[Create a New Monitoring Plan](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/creating-monitoring-plans.md) topic for additional information.

**Step 2 –** Fine-tune data source settings, if necessary: use the data source properties to modify
data collection settings, customize the monitoring scope, and more.

**Step 3 –** Add items to be monitored. An item is a specific object you want to audit, e.g., a
VMware server or a SharePoint farm. As soon as the item is added, to the monitoring plan, Auditor
starts collecting data from it. See the
[Add Items for Monitoring](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/index.md#add-items-for-monitoring) topic for additional
information.

**Step 4 –** To view and modify your plans, in the main Auditor window click the Monitoring Plans
tile, then expand the All Monitoring Plans tree.

## Using historical data

For many data sources, you can instruct Netwrix Auditor to collect state-in-time data along with
event data. For that, Netwrix Auditor uses state-in-time snapshots of the relevant system (for
example, see [VMware](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/monitoring-scope.md)).

To keep users up-to-date on actual system state, Auditor updates the latest snapshot on the regular
basis. Thus, only the latest snapshot is available for ongoing reporting in the product.

However, you may need to generate reports based on the historical data. For that, you must import
the historical snapshots to the database.

To import snapshots, you must be assigned the _Global administrator_ or the _Global reviewer_ role.

Follow the steps to import historical snapshots.

**Step 1 –** Select the monitoring plan you need.

**Step 2 –** Select the required data source and click **Edit data source** on the right to open its
properties.

**Step 3 –** Click **General** on the left.

**Step 4 –** In the **Manage historical snapshots** section, click **Manage**.

**Step 5 –** In the **Manage Snapshots** window, select the snapshots that you want to import — use
the arrows to move the selected snapshots to the **Snapshots available for reporting** list. When
finished, click **OK**.

See the [Role-Based Access and Delegation](/docs/auditor/10.7/monitoring-plans/delegation-and-permissions.md) topic for additional information.
