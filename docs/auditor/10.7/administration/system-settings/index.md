# Integrations

Netwrix Auditor Integration API—endless integration, auditing and reporting capabilities.

The Netwrix Auditor Integration API provides access to audit data collected by Netwrix Auditor
through REST API endpoints. According to the RESTful model, each operation is associated with a URL.
Integration API provides the following capabilities:

- Data in: Solidify security and meet regulatory compliance standards by enabling visibility into
  what is going on in any third-party application.
- Data out: Further automate your business processes, IT security and operations workflows by
  enriching third-party solutions with actionable audit data.

Netwrix Auditor Integration API is enabled by default and communicates through port 9699. Navigate
to Settings → Integrations to adjust port settings and review information about possible
integrations.

Netwrix recommends adding a special data source to your monitoring plan—Netwrix API.

In Netwrix Auditor 9.0, Netwrix has updated API schemas. See the
[Compatibility Notice](/docs/auditor/10.7/api-reference/index.md) topic for additional information.
