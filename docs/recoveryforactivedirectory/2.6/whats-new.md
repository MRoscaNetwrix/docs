## Recovery for Active Directory v2.6

Netwrix Recovery for Active DirectoryÂ v2.6 enables comprehensive domain controller backup and
recovery. If your domain controllers get corrupted, encrypted due to ransomware, or even completely
wiped out either intentionally or accidentally, you can always recover your Active Directory forest
from a secure backup.

**NOTE:** The dashboard has been deprecated in this version.

New: Automated AD Forest Recovery

Enhance the availability of your Active Directory with a rapid and reliable automated recovery
process for entire Active Directory forests and domains. Benefit from significantly improved storage
optimization, reducing backup sizes from 20GB to just 10MB.

New: Flexible Backup and Restore Options

Backup and restore physical or virtual domain controllers regardless of their hosting environment.
Maximize flexibility and ensure seamless recovery processes for any Active Directory infrastructure.

New: Data Retention Policy

Stale data can now be purged from the database using a configurable range and options. You can
specify x number of days after which backup data will be deleted.

New: Integration with Netwrix Threat Prevention (formerly StealthINTERCEPT)

Improve threat detection and response by combining Active Directory change data with real-time
security intelligence from Netwrix Threat Prevention. This integration provides a comprehensive view
of AD activity, enabling faster incident investigation and resolution.

Enhancement: Unified Interface for Object Rollback and Recovery

The Rollback and Recover navigation items have been merged into a consolidated Active Directory
interface to enhance user experience. This simplifies object rollback and recovery, enabling faster,
easier management for IT teams.
