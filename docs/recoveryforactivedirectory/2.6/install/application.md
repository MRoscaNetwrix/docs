# Install the Application

The following components are installed by the Recovery for Active Directory installation package:

- Netwrix Recovery Server
- Netwrix Recovery Web Console – Installed on the Recovery Application Server and used to perform
  the operations the application offers
- RSAT Extension – Installed on the Recovery Application Server automatically. You can manually
  install it on a remote machine to add the object rollback and restore functions to the Active
  Directory Users and Computers console on that machine.
- Recovery Configuration Utility – Installed on the Recovery Application Server and used to register
  the RSAT Extension on the server. It also provides the option to update the SQL database password.

During a fresh installation, it is possible to modify both or either the application installation
directory and the SQL Server database location. The application installation directory can be
modified through the Destination Folder page in the Recovery for Active Directory Setup Wizard.

:::note
The `msoledbsql.msi` must be installed on the machine the Recovery Application Server will
be installed on, prior to installing the Recovery Application Server. This allows the Recovery
Application Server to connect with the SQL Server. If it is not installed, the installer fails on
the SQL Server Configuration page. The
[Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56730)
can be downloaded directly from Microsoft.
