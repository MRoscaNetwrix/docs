# Install the RSAT Extension

The RSAT Extension is installed automatically on the machine where the Recovery Application Server
and web console are installed. To use the RSAT Extension on a remote machine where Active Directory
Users and Computers (ADUC) is installed, you have to manually install it using the RSAT installer.
The installer is located in the following installation directory on the Recovery Application Server:

...Netwrix\Recovery for Active Directory\RSAT Extension\NetwrixRecovery_RSAT_Extension.msi

Follow the steps to install the RSAT Extension.

**Step 1 –** Copy the `NetwrixRecovery_RSAT_Extension.msi` file to the machine where you want to
install it.

**Step 2 –** Run `NetwrixRecovery_RSAT_Extension.msi` . The RSAT Extension Setup wizard opens.

**Step 6 –** In the Server name field, enter the name or IP address of the Recovery Application
Server, so the RSAT Extension identifies it in the environment.

**NOTE:** 9001 is the default port. If a different port is specified on the Netwrix Recovery Server
Configuration page of the Recovery for Active Directory Setup wizard while installing the
application, then that specific port is applicable here.
