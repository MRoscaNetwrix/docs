# Upgrade Procedure

This topic describes the steps needed to upgrade Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory from v2.5 to
v2.6.

## Upgrade Recovery for Active Directory v2.5 to v2.6

Run the `NetwrixRecovery_Setup.exe` on the Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory server to upgrade
to the newer version of the product. See the [Install the Application](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/2.6/getting-started/installation.md) topic for
additional information.

**NOTE:** The database does not change between versions, so the same can be used for the new
version. Do not uninstall or remove the existing database.

Recovery for Active Directory v2.5Â has now been upgraded to v2.6.
