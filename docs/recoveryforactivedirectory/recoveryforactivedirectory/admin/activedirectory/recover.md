# Recover Objects

The Recycle Bin enables you to view the objects deleted in domains monitored by Recovery for Active
Directory. You can recover these deleted Active Directory objects from the Recycle Bin.

Click **Active Directory** in the left pane to open the [Active Directory Page](overview.md). Select
and expand a domain in the left pane and click Recycle Bin to get a list of deleted objects in the
domain.

You can recover deleted objects.

The page displays the following information:

- Name – The display name of the object
- Distinguished Name – The unique name identifying the object in the directory
- Last Known Parent – The path of the parent of the object
- Type – The object type, showing whether it is a container, organizational unit, computer, group,
  user, etc.
- Deleted On – The time and date when the object was deleted
- Time Left – The time remaining until the object is no longer recoverable

Search for an Object

There are several ways to find an object:

- Column Filters – Click a column header to organize the table alphabetically by the column header.
  An arrow appears by the column name. Use it to arrange the entries by ascending or descending
  order.
- Search box – Enter a text string in the search box to filter the table for results that contain
  the text.

**Step 5 –** Select a domain controller where the restore operation will get affected. Options are:

**Step 7 –** On the Recovery Options page, select the Container and Naming Conflict actions for the
recovery process.

- Container – When a container is deleted in Active Directory, all child objects are also deleted.
  Select a container restore option from the drop-down menu:

    - Only restore the container object – Restores the container object but no children
    - Restore the container object and the immediate children – Restores the container object and
      its immediate children
    - Restore the entire sub-tree – Restores the container object and all children

    **NOTE:** Selecting the Restore the container object and the immediate children or the Restore
    the entire sub-tree option enables the User Options page.

- Naming Conflict – A naming conflict can occur if an object was created post-deletion that has
  identical values to the original object. From the drop-down menu, select an option to implement if
  a naming conflict occurs:

    - Skip the object – If there is a conflict with naming, do not restore and skip the object
    - Automatically use alternative values – If there is a conflict with naming, a numeric value
      will be appended to the name of the object being restored to create a unique name

**Step 8 –** Click **Next**.

![Object Restore wizard - User Options page](../../../../../static/img/product_docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/recoveryforactivedirectory/admin/activedirectory/useroptions.webp)

**Step 9 –** The User Options page is displayed when user objects are being restored. When a user
object is included as a child object being restored, this page is also displayed. Select the check
boxes to configure the necessary options for the user.

- Enable user – Enables the user in Active Directory
- Clear 'User must change password' flag upon restoration – Restored users do not receive an alert
  to change their password upon first login after a recovery. Instead, their old password prior to
  deletion is still active.
- Set new password – Implement a new password upon recovery. Type the new password in the text box.

    _Remember,_ when a new password is created, the user needs it to login the first time. The
    password should be copied and given to the restored user.

**Step 10 –** Click **Next**.

**Step 11 –** The account preforming the operation must have Domain Admin privileges to access the
domain tree area where the object resides. On the Credentials page:

- If the account specified during domain configuration has Domain Admin privileges, click **Next**.
- If the domain account does not have Domain Admin privileges, select the **Use alternate
  credentials to perform the object restore** checkbox and enter an account with Domain Admin
  privileges, then click **Next**.

For a Least Privilege Access Model to provision an Active Directory security group with the
permissions that are necessary to perform backups, rollbacks and recovery, see the
