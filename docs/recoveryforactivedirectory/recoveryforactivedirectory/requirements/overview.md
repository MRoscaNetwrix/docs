# Requirements

This topic describes the recommended configuration of the servers needed to install Recovery for Active Directory in a production environment.

___RECOMMENDED:___ Review your environment and requirements with a Netwrixsupport engineer prior to deployment to ensure all exceptions are covered.

## Architecture Overview

The following servers are required for installation of the application:

Core Component

- Netwrix Recovery for Active Directory Application Server – This is where the (v2.6) application is installed
- SQL Server for Recovery for Active Directory Database – As a data-intensive application, a well-provisioned, dedicated SQL Server is recommended
- RSAT Extension – Active Directory Users and Computers extension enabling Recovery for Active Directory features from within Microsoft management utilities

See the following topics for server requirements:

- [Application Server Requirements](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/recoveryforactivedirectory/requirements/server.md)
- [SQL Server Requirements](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/recoveryforactivedirectory/requirements/sqlserver.md)
- [RSAT Extension Requirements](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/recoveryforactivedirectory/requirements/rsatextension.md)

Target Domain Considerations

The target domains include the Active Directory domains that can be added through the [Domains Page](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/recoveryforactivedirectory/admin/configuration/domain.md). See the following topic for target domain considerations:

- [Target Domains](/docs/recoveryforactivedirectory/recoveryforactivedirectory/requirements/targetdomain.md)

Target Server Considerations

Target servers include the servers and environments where you want to restore a domain controller or an entire forest. See the following topic for target server requirements:
