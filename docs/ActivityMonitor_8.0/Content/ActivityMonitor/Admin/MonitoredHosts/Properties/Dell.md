# Dell Tab

The Dell tab on a host’s Properties window displays the Dell Celerra/VNX, Dell Isilon/PowerScale, Dell PowerStore, or Dell Unity host to be monitored for activity and any host aliases. This tab is populated with the information entered when the Dell host is added to the monitored hosts table. If desired, specify a different device to be monitored for activity.
