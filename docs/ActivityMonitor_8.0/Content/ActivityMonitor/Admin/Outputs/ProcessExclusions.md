# Process Exclusions Tab

The Process Exclusions tab on an output Properties window is where monitoring scope by Windows processes can be modified. These settings are initially configured when the output is added.

**NOTE:** Netwrix product processes are excluded by default from activity monitoring.

Select an output for a Windows file server host on the Monitored Hosts tab and click **Edit** to open the output Properties window.
