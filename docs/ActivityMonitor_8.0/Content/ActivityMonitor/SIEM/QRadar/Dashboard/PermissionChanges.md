The Permission Changes dashboard contains the following cards:

* Activity – Timeline of all permission change events over the specified time interval
* Top Users – Displays up-to the top five users associated with permission change events over the specified time interval
* Latest Events – Tabular format of all permission change events which occurred over the specified time interval

  * See the [Table Card Features](../App#Table_Card_Features "Navigates to the Table Card Features section")  topic for additional information.

The time interval is identified in the upper-right corner with the Start and End boxes. This is set by default to the “past day,” or 24 hours. To search within a different interval, either manually type the desired date and time or use the calendar buttons to set the desired date and time interval. Then click Search to refresh the card data.
