# Usercube-Prepare-Synchronization

`Usercube-Prepare-Synchronization` is used as the second step of the [Synchronization](../../../synchronization/index) process. It cleanses exported CSV files before sending them to the server for database loading. It is performed on the *Agent* side.

## Behavior Details

The task reads files from the source directory, usually the temp folder > ExportOutput folder. See the [Application Settings](../../../network-configuration/server-configuration/general-purpose/index) topic for additional information.

### Cleanse data

The following actions are performed on the *CSV source files*:

1. Remove columns that are not used in [Entity Type Mapping](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entitytypemapping/index) or [Entity Association Mapping](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entityassociationmapping/index).
2. Remove entries that have a null primary key.
3. Remove duplicates.
4. Sort entries according to the primary key.

The result of the *Prepare-Synchronization* is stored in the [Application Settings](../../../network-configuration/server-configuration/general-purpose/index "Application Settings") as three files:

* For every entity type of the relevant *Connector* involved in an [Entity Type Mapping](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entitytypemapping/index) or an [Entity Association Mapping](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/entityassociationmapping/index), a `.sorted.csv` file is generated, containing the final, cleansed and sorted result.
* Duplicates are kept in a separate `.duplicates.csv` file.
* Null primary key entries are kept in a separate `.nullpk.csv` file.

:::note
All files produced by the task are in the work folder > Collect directory. See the Application Settings topic for additional information.

### Compute changes

In *incremental* mode, changes might need to be computed by the *Agent*:

* If the Export step has provided computed changes, no further process is required. The changes will be sent as-is to the server.
* If the Export step has provided a full extract of the managed systems, the *Prepare-Synchronization* step computes changes. This computation is based on the result of the last data cleansing, generated by the previous *Prepare-Synchronization*, and stored in the `previous` folder in the *export directory*. See the [Application Settings](../../../network-configuration/server-configuration/general-purpose/index) topic for additional information.

:::note
For incremental mode, it is recommended, whenever possible, to use managed systems to compute changes. Dedicated workstations and knowledge of the inner data organization allow managed systems to compute changes with performance that Identity Manager can't match. Using managed systems for these operations avoids generating heavy files and alleviates Identity Manager's processing load.
:::

The result is a set of clean lists of changes stored as a `.sorted.delta` file containing a *command* column. The *command* column can take the following values:

* *insert*
* *update*
* *delete*
* *merge*

These values are instructions for the *Synchronization* step to apply the changes to the database.

The `.sorted` file (that is, the **original** clean export file, **not** the changes) is stored in the `previous` folder inside the *export directory*. It will be used as a reference for the next *incremental* Prepare-Synchronization to compute the changes, if needed. See the [Application Settings](../../../network-configuration/server-configuration/general-purpose/index) topic for additional information.

Tampering with the `previous` folder content would result in false changes leading to false computation. It would result in data corruption in the Identity Manager database. To restore the Identity Manager database and reflect the managed system data updates, a *complete**Sync Up* would be required.

### Prepare the server

At the beginning of every *Prepare-Synchronization* process, the *Server* is notified via HTTP.

Upon receiving the notification, the server creates a directory on its host environment, identified by a unique GUID, to contain `.sorted` or `.sorted.delta` files that will be sent by the agent.

This is designed to prevent network errors that would cause an *incremental* database update to happen more than once.

This means that several *Export* and *Prepare-Synchronization* tasks can be executed simultaneously. These tasks will be processed by the server one at a time, in the right order.

Any notification of a *complete* Prepare-Synchronization would cancel the previous non-processed *incremental* Prepare-Synchronizations. As a *complete* Prepare-Synchronization reloads the whole database, it renders *incremental* changes computation moot.

### Send clean exports

`.sorted` or `.sorted.delta` files are sent over HTTP to the *Server* for the last step.

### Example

The figure models the complete *Prepare-Synchronization* steps applied to an Active Directory export. The matching *Connector* defines an Entity Type *AD Entry* and two associations (*members* and *manager*).

## Examples

`Usercube-Prepare-Synchronization` can be used as an executable file as follows:

```
./Usercube-Prepare-Synchronization --api-url myserver.usercube.com --api-client-id myclientid --api-secret myclient secret --connector --agent myagent --synchronization-mode complete

```
## Arguments

| Name | Details |
| --- | --- |
| --agent required | **Type**  [Agent](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/agent/index)    **Description** Identifier of the agent where the task runs. |
| --connector required | **Type**  [Connector](../../../toolkit/xml-configuration/connectors/connector/index)    **Description** Identifier of the linked connector. The task is linked to a connector whose entity types are synchronized. |
| --synchronization-mode required | **Type**  [Upward Data Synchronization](../../../synchronization/upward-data-sync/index)Mode  **Description** Synchronization mode for this task can be one of the following:   * Initial * Complete * Incremental   This must be the same as the associated Export and Synchronize tasks. Use *initial* if this is the first time the target managed system is synchronized. Use *complete* to load the data from the managed system as a whole. Use *incremental* to consider only incremental changes from the last synchronization. In *incremental* mode, the Prepare-Synchronization task computes changes in the source managed system since the last *Prepare-Synchronization*. |
| --sources-directory default value: ExportOutput | **Type**  String  **Description** Directory path, relative to temp folder, from which export files to cleanse are read.
