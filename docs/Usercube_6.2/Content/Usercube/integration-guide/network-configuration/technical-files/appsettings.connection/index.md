# appsettings.connection

## Define configuration through UI

On some configuration screens, such as the connector screen, it is possible to define some of the [Agent Configuration](../../agent-configuration/index "Agent Configuration"). This configuration is stored in the **appsettings.connection.json** file, located inside the [Application Settings](../../agent-configuration/appsettings/index "Application Settings").

The **appsettings.connection.json** file has the exact same structure as the other [appsettings.agent](../../agent-configuration/appsettings-agent/index "appsettings.agent") file.

:::note
This configuration file has the highest priority among others agent's configuration sources . See the
