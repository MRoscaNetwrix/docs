# Notifications

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when an action is expected, or a job ends with an error.

Identity Manager provides [Native Notifications](native/index "Native Notifications") for usual cases, for example provisioning review, resource reconciliation, and role reconciliation.

[Custom Notifications](custom/index "Custom Notifications") can be configured for specific needs, to be triggered by a workflow, or periodically via a task.
