# Native Notifications

Identity ManagerÂ provides native notifications for usual cases, for example role review, provisioning review, access certification, manual provisioning, etc.

## Overview

Identity Manager natively sends notifications for:

* Password reset to the users whose passwords are reset;
* Access certification to the users selected as reviewers;
* [Manual Provisioning](manual-provisioning/index "Manual Provisioning"), provisioning review and role review to the users who own a profile with the permissions to perform the corresponding actions;
* Jobs that finished in state completed/errored/aborted/blocked/warning to the users who own a profile with the corresponding permissions.

Concerning the notifications sent via permissions:  
In order to receive the notifications, a profile must have the full permission path. Having a (great-)parent permission will not enable notifications for all child entities.
  
For example, the permission /ProvisioningPolicy/PerformManualProvisioning/Directory\_User allows a profile to perform manual provisioning with Directory\_User as the source entity type, and receive the corresponding notifications. On the contrary, the permission `/ProvisioningPolicy/PerformManualProvisioning/` allows a profile to perform manual provisioning for all entity types, but not receive the corresponding notifications.

See the [References: Permissions](../../profiles-permissions/permissions/index "References: Permissions") topic for additional information.
  
  
Each permission can be configured in an [Access Control Rule](../../toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/index "AccessControlRule") so that the corresponding notification is disabled.

All notifications are built based on cshtml templates. The templates for native notifications can be found in `/Runtime/NotificationTemplates`.

The templates for native notifications can be adjusted to specific needs through the XML tag [Notification Template](../../toolkit/xml-configuration/notifications/notificationtemplate/index "NotificationTemplate").
  
See the [Customize a Native Notification](../how-tos/customize-native-notification/index "Customize a Native Notification") for additional information on how to customize native notifications.
