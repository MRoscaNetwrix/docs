# Password Reset Settings

This set of password reset settings contains the configuration to perform password reset operations such as change, reset, etc.

## Examples

The following example declares a password reset settings.

```


```
### Password length and counts

The following example makes Identity Manager generate a password with at least 12 characters in total, at least 8 lowercase characters, 4 uppercase characters, 2 digits and 2 symbols.

```


```
:::note
As the total of all counts (16) is greater than the length (12), the password length will be the count total (16).
:::

The following example makes Identity Manager generate a password with at least 12 characters in total, at least 8 lowercase characters, 4 uppercase characters, 2 digits and 2 symbols.

```


```
:::note
As the total of all counts (4) is lower than the length (8), the password will be generated with 8 characters, among them 1 lowercase character, 1 uppercase character, 1 digit, 1 symbol, and 4 more random characters.
:::

The generated password's strength can also be checked via a regular expression (regex) through `StrengthCheck`. Thus, the following example makes Identity Manager generate a password with at least 9 characters including at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase and one special character.

```
