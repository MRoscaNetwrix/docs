# Simulation Access Control Rules

This scaffolding generates the rights to configure and launch simulations.

It also gives access to a shortcut on the dashboard allowing to enter the simulation screen. Through this screen, simulations can be launched and results can be visualized.

The scaffolding generates the following scaffoldings:

* [Policy Simulation Control Rules](../../accesscontrolrules/simulations/policysimulationcontrolrules/index "Policy Simulation Control Rules"):
* [Role And Simulation Control Rules](../../accesscontrolrules/simulations/roleandsimulationcontrolrules/index "Role And Simulation Control Rules"):
