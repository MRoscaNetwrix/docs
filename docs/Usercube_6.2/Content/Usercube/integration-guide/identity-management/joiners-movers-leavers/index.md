# Identity Lifecycle: Joiners, Movers and Leavers

Identities' Joiners, Movers and Leavers (JML) process can be made easy by using the adequate model: records.

In Identity Manager, the JML process is done through workflows or through synchronization to the HR system.

See the [Onboarding and Offboarding](on-offboarding/index "Onboarding and Offboarding") and [Position Change via Records](position-change/index "Position Change via Records") topics for additional information on onboarding and offboarding and position changes via records.
