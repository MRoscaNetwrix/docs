# UAR Owner

Owners are set up by the UAR administrator to perform permission and/or membership reviews to assure

Owners are notified with an email message when a new review has been assigned. You can click one of
the links in the email, or login to NetSuite and open [User Access Review](/docs/platgovnetsuite/uar/access_app.md) to
access the dashboard.
