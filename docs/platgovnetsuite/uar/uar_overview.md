# Welcome

Roles and Permissions are not a set once and forget about them activity. Both should be reviewed
regularly to ensure your data is secured and users in your organization have the right access.
**User Access Review** streamlines this review process, making it easy to manage and review all
access to your NetSuite data. UAR users must have a [license](/docs/platgovnetsuite/uar/install_app.md).

## Terminology

Here are the basic terms used throughout the UAR guide:

- UAR Reviewer Roles
- Review Types
- Access Review
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Permissions and Roles

### UAR Reviewer Roles

Access and permissions to UAR is controlled by roles:

- **UAR Admin** manages the UAR process. This reviewer can:

    - Assign Role Owners.
    - Create Single or Global User Access Reviews.
    - Check Status of UARs.
    - Send reminders to Owners.
    - Run reporting.

- **UAR Owner** performs Role Permission and Role Membership Reviews. This reviewer can:

    - Review and Complete UARs.
    - Request Changes to Permission or Permission Levels to owned Roles.
    - Request Changes to Role Assignments for owned Roles.
    - Designate an Additional Approver for a Membership Review for owned Roles. For example, a user
      that does not report to you has a Role you own. You may want the user’s supervisor to also
      approve the Role Assignment.

- **UAR Auditor** read-only access to the UAR to perform auditing functions.
- **UAR Additional Reviewer** performs assigned membership reviews. Additional reviewers are
  assigned by the UAR Owners.

### Review Types

Reviews can be single or global. A global review is a group of single reviews assigned to one or
more owners.

- Users only have required roles.
- Unused roles and access are identified and removed.
- Folder access is restricted.

### Principle of Least Privilege
