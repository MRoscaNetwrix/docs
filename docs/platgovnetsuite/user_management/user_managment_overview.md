# User Management

These reports are available on the User Management Menu:

- **Employees with Standard Roles** identifies all employees assigned to standard roles.
- **Employees with Unused Logins** identifies any employees who have not logged in.
- **Employee Permission Changes** identifies all permission changes that have occurred.
- **Unused Roles - Not Assigned** identifies roles not assigned to any user.
- **Unused Roles - Assigned But Not In Use** identifies roles assigned to a user, but never used.
- **Role Assignments with No Login in Six Months** identifies assigned roles where a user has not
  logged in within the past six months.
- **Employees with Multiple Roles** identifies users with multiple roles. Multiple roles create
  conflicts. Users who require multiple roles for support or administration can be isolated in a
  sandbox using Platform Governance for NetSuite to keep the sandbox the same as production for
  troubleshooting and support.
- **Current Global Permission** identifies users with global permissions, which can cause conflicts.
  Best practice is to not use global permissions on a long-term basis.
