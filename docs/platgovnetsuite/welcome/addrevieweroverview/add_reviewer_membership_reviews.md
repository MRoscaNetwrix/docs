# Additional Reviewer Membership Reviews

This type of review is used to keep your roles up to date. When you click on a membership review,
the list of users with the role is displayed. The links open the appropriate record in NetSuite, for
example the **User** link opens the **User** record.

As an **Additional Reviewer**, you can only review Users in the Role Membership that are assigned to
you. Look for rows with no highlighting, with the **Status** of **Additional Reviewer** assigned to
you.

Reviews open on the **Review** tab. The **Review Notes** tab lists the review details for the
review.
