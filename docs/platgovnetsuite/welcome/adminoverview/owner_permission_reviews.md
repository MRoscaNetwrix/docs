# Permission Reviews

This type of review is used to keep your role permissions up to date. When you click on a permission
review, the permissions list is displayed. Access permission reviews from **UAR List** in your menu
bar, or one of the review shortcuts.

Reviews open on the **Review** tab. The **Review Notes** tab lists the review details for the
review.
