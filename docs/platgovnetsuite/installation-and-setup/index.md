# Installation Overview

Installing Platform Governance for NetSuite is straight forward. Follow the steps in these topics to
install the bundle, set access for the Strongpoint tab on the NetSuite toolbar, and manage users.
There is a **Next Step** link at the end of each installation topic.

The bundle is installed using processor architecture for scheduled scripts. All deployments are set
to low priority.

1. [Installing Strongpoint](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation-and-setup/installation-guide.md)
2. [Running the Spider](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation-and-setup/running-the-spider.md)
3. [Setting Up AutoSpider and Alerts](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation-and-setup/auto-spider-alerts.md)
4. [Managing Users](/docs/platgovnetsuite/security-and-compliance/user-management.md)
5. [Setting Access to the Strongpoint Tab](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation-and-setup/permissions-and-access.md)
6. [Setting Role Permissions](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation-and-setup/permissions-and-access.md)

Once your installation is complete, you can review the
[Installation Settings](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation-and-setup/initial-configuration.md) report.

Optional menu items are hidden by default to keep the menus clean and easy to use. If users do not
see a menu item, they can turn it on through [Menu Management](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation-and-setup/menus-and-navigation.md), assuming the
feature is included in your [License Type](/docs/platgovnetsuite/getting-started/requirements-and-licensing.md).
