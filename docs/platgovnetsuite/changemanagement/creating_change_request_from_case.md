# Creating a Change Request from a Case

If
[Enable Case to Change Request Workflow](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/installation_settings_report.md)
is enabled, you can automatically create a Change Request directly from your Case:

1. Open **Lists** > **Support** > **Cases**.
2. **View** a Case.
3. Click **Create Change Request**.

The Change Request is created, populating the fields specified in the
[Case to Change Request Field Mapping](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/installation_settings_report.md)
set up. The Change Request status is set to **Not Started**.

If the **Create Change Request** button is not visible on the Case, the
[Enable Case to Change Request Workflow](/docs/platgovnetsuite/installation/installation_settings_report.md)
is not enabled. Contact your system administrator.
