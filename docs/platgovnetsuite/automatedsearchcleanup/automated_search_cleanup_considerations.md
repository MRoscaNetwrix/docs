# Automated Search Clean Up Considerations

This list describes some of the special cases encountered when using the
[Automated Search Clean Up](/docs/platgovnetsuite/automatedsearchcleanup/automated_search_cleanup.md) tool

1. When an archived search contains **Date** filters, you must have the same date format preference
   as the Companyâ€™s date preference to accurately restore the filter.
2. SuiteScript cannot delete **Pricing** searches. Pricing searches are not displayed in the Clean
   Up preview and are excluded from the Automated Search Clean Up.
3. Private searches with a **Period** filter cannot be deleted. SuiteScript returns an **Unexpected
   Error** when trying to temporarily set the search as public to delete it.
4. Searches with **Period** filter cannot be fully restored. Only public searches can be deleted for
   searches with **Period** filter.

### Limitations to Restoring Auto Archived Searches

Items from the **Criteria** and **Results** tabs are restored with the exception of **Public**
searches with the **Period** filter. Auto archiving does not occur with **Private** searches with
the **Period** filter, as they cannot be deleted or archived.

The following check boxes on the Search form are not restored if they were checked:

- Available as List View
- Available as Dashboard View
- Available as SubList View
- Available for Reminders
- Show in Menu

Items from the following tabs on the Search form are not retained when an auto archived search is
restored:

- Highlighting
- Available Filters
- Audience
- Email
- Audit Trail: the restored search is assigned a new Internal ID. The audit trail only contains
  entries for the new Internal ID.
