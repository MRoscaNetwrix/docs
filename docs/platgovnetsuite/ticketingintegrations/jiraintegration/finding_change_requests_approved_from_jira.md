# Finding Change Requests from Jira

To find your change requests that originated in Jira:

Create a Saved Search:

1. Open **Lists** > **Search** > **Saved Searches** > **New**
2. Click **Change Request**
3. Best practice is to title the search something meaningful, such as **Find Change Requests from
   Jira**
4. You can add it to your dashboard, list view, reminders, or show it in your menu if you use this
   search frequently.
5. Add the filter:  
   **Originated system**  
   **is**  
   **Set by Jira**
6. Click **Preview** to review your search.
7. **Save** your Search.

The search runs when you save it. To run it in the future:

1. Open **Lists** > **Search** > **Saved Searches**
2. Select **View** by your search.
