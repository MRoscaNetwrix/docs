- **Synchronized with** displays the connected account. Click **Change Account** to switch to a
  different Account.
- **Policy** is blank until Customizations have been added. The Policy is determined by the
  Customization with the strictest policy.
- **Affected Bundle ID** can be added to the ticket. Enter the ID in the **Add Bundle ID** entry box
  and click (**+**) to add it. You can delete an Affected Bundle ID with the
  ![delete](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/delete.webp)icon.
- **Change Level Required** is **Log Changes Only** until Customizations have been added. If there
  are multiple change levels, the most stringent one is applied.

- **Impact Analysis** and **View ERD** are tools to Perform Risk Assessment.

### Add Existing Customizations by Name or Script ID

1. Click **Lookup Customization**.
2. Enter all or part of a Name.. For this example, enter **new**.
3. Click **+** to search for matching Customizations. **View** displays the **Type** and **Script
   ID** for a Customization.

    ![Add a Customization by Name](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_add_name.webp)

4. Select one or more Customizations. For this example, select **New Opportunities Created
   (Search)**.
5. Click **Add Selected Customizations**. The selected Customization is added to the **Existing
   Customizations** list.

    ![New Opportunities Created (Search) added to Existing Customizations](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_new_opp.webp)

6. Enter the Script ID **custentity_fmt_cust_credit_on_hold** in **Add Customizations** and click
   **+**.
7. The **Set Customer Credit on Hold (Entity Field)** is displayed. Select it, and click **Add
   Selected Customizations**. The selected Customization is added to the **Existing Customizations**
   list. The **Change Level Required** changes from **Log Changes Only** to **Change Request**,
   which is the policy for the **Set Customer Credit on Hold** field.

### Add Proposed Customizations

In this procedure, we are adding a new Customization.

1. Enter a new, valid Script ID in the **Add Customizations** field. For this example, enter
   **customlist_customer_priorities**.
2. Click (**+**) to add it. If the Script ID is valid, and does not match an existing Script ID, the
   new Customization is added to the **Proposed Customizations** list.

    ![Customization added to Proposed Customization list](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_proposed_customization.webp)

### Create the Change Request

If you expand the **Change Request** field on the right, the status is **Not Synced with
Strongpoint**.

1. Change the Jira status of your ticket to match the status set up for **Jira Statuses for In
   Progress Status**. For example, **In Progress**.
2. Click **Push** to create the Change Request. This step is required for both manual and automatic
   synchronization. A confirmation your Change Request was Created/Updated is displayed. The change
   request is created in NetSuite with the **In Progress** status. If you mapped some of your Jira
   statuses, then **Push** is only available those mapped statuses.
3. Expand the **Change Request** field on the right. The status is now **In Progress**. There is a
   link to open the Change Request in NetSuite.

    ![Change Request set to In Progress](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_in_progress.webp)

### Import Customizations from Jira

In this procedure, we are adding customizations exported into an xml file. This is not required, but
is an alternative if you have a lot of customizations.

1. Click **Import Customization**.

    ![Import customizations from an xml file.](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_import_cust.webp)

2. Click **Choose File**, navigate to your xml file and click **Open**.
3. Click **Import**. The customizations appear in the **Existing Customizations** list.

    ![The customizations appear in the Existing Customizations list.](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_import_cust2.webp)

## Perform Risk Assessment

### Impact Analysis

The impact analysis tool reviews your customizations for dependencies or risks. Click **Impact
Analysis** to run the tool. Here is an example report:

![Impact analysis report](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_impact_analysis.webp)

Before proceeding with your changes, review each warning to ensure your change does not break
something. Dependencies can easily be reviewed with the ERD tool.

### View ERD

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool graphically displays your Customizations and all
dependencies.

1. Click **View ERD**.
2. Select the Customization to view from the list. For this example, select **Set Customer Credit on
   Hold (Entity Field)**.
3. When the diagram opens, you can explore the dependencies to evaluate the effect of your intended
   changes.

    ![Run the ERD to view dependencies](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_erd.webp)

## Ready for Development

Once you have resolved any risk or conflicts, your changes are ready for development:

1. Change the Jira status of your ticket to match the status set up for **Jira Statuses for Pending
   Approval Status**. For example, **Selected for Development**.
2. Click **Push** if you are not using [Automatic Synchronization](/docs/platgovnetsuite/ticketingintegrations/jiraintegration/jira_integration.md) to push
   status changes. A confirmation your Change Request was Created/Updated is displayed.
3. Expand the **Change Request** field on the right. The status is now **Pending Approval**. There
   is a link to open the Change Request in NetSuite.

    ![Change Request is set to Pending Approval](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_pending_approval.webp)

4. Click the **Go To Record** link to view the Change Request.

    ![Change Request is Pending Approval](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_change_request.webp)

## Deploy Changes and Complete the Ticket

When development is done, and the Change Request is approved according to your policy, the Jira
ticket is ready to be updated.

1. Expand the **Change Request** field on the right. The status is **Approved**.  
   ![Change Request is now Approved](/img/product_docs/platgovnetsuite/integrations/jira_example_approved.webp)
2. Change the Jira status of your ticket to match the status set up for **Jira Statuses for Approved
   Status**. In our example set up, we have two possible statuses: **Ready for Deployment** and
   **Done**. Setting up two statuses enables you to split up the deployment and the ticket closure
   if you want to monitor the deployment task separately. Both statuses are valid for Deployment,
   but only **Done** closes the Jira ticket and updates the Change Request to **Completed**.
3. Click **Push** if you are not using [Automatic Synchronization](/docs/platgovnetsuite/ticketingintegrations/jiraintegration/jira_integration.md) to push
   status changes. A confirmation your Change Request was Created/Updated is displayed.
4. If you used **Ready for Deployment**, update your Jira status to **Done** once your deployment
   and verification activities are complete.

If you open the Change Request in NetSuite:

- All Customizations added from Jira are displayed.
- **Affected Bundle ID** is added (if used).
- **Change Overview** is set to the Jira ticket description.
- Change Request is **Approved** and ready to be deployed.
- **Originated System**, **External Change Request Number** and **External Link** to the Jira ticket
  are populated on the **Related Change Records** tab.
- If the Jira status is **Done**, the Change Request shows as **Completed**.
