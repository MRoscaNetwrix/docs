# Investigating Through Saved Searches

After running all the mass updates and CSV imports (where needed), you can build six saved searches,
one for each scenario. Within each scenario you can easily identify all the customizations for
further investigation.

Included in the results columns of these saved searches, you will find the following fields:

- **Name**: to identify the customization.
- **ScriptID**: to locate the customization.
- **Type**: to know more about the customization.
- **Date Last Used ([DLU](/docs/platgovnetsuite/operations/maintenance/cleanup-strategies.md))**: to know the last time the customization
  was used.

The columns show the existing relationships for the customizations that use:

- Parent
- Scripts
- Searches/Mass Updates
- Workflows
- Data Sources
- Forms
- List
