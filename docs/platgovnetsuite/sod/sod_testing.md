# SoD Testing Mode

Testing Mode helps you implement a new SoD solution, or to clean up your existing account. By
creating and running rules in a test mode, you can identify and resolve potential issues with a rule
without creating SoD incidents.

Testing Mode provides two ways to test a rule without generating SoD incidents:

- Test on Roles: checks to see if there are any roles violating the rule.
- Test on Employees: checks to see if any employees are violating the rule.

The violations list in Employee or Role customizations are updated during testing.

To access Testing Mode:

1. Create a new Rule or edit an existing Rule:  
   **SoD** > **SoD Rule Library** > **New** or **Search**
2. Open the **SoD Rule Processing Status** tab.
3. Select **Test on Roles** or **Test on Employees**.
4. Click **Run SoD**Â to run the test. It can take over an hour to evaluate large accounts.

Any of these events require a role to be re-evaluated:

**Trigger Role Job**

- Anytime Role(s) are added/updated
- Anytime the Rules are added/updated
- Manual trigger on the Role

**Trigger Role Assignment**

- Anytime Role(s) are added/updated
- Anytime the Rules are added/updated
- Anytime Role Assignments on an Employee are added/updated
- Anytime Global Permissions are added/updated
- Also triggered when the Manual trigger on the Role is selected
- Manual Trigger on the Employee

You can manually start the evaluation process, or wait until the Spider runs overnight. To manually
run the process:

1. Open **SoD** > **SoD Processing Status** > **Run SoD on User Roles**
2. Select all of the roles you have modified.
3. Click **Run SoD**

## Test Reports

Test Reports are available for both **User Role Test Violations** and **Employee Test Violations**:
