# User Properties

You can view and manipulate the properties of directory objects (users, mailboxes, and contacts) in the connected identity store, depending on the permissions the GroupID administrator has granted you.

**You can:**

* Select the required object and click **Properties** on the toolbar. The object's properties page is displayed.
* Click **Save** after making any changes in any properties' tab
* Click **Delete** to delete that user, contact, or mailbox.
* Click **Add to Contacts** on the toolbar. The portal creates the direct report's vCard and prompts you to save it on your machine. You can then use it to add the direct report's email address to your email contact list.
* Click **Send email** on the toolbar. This launches the default Windows email application for sending an email to the direct report.
* Click Reset Password to reset the password for the object.
* Click **Organizational Hierarchy** to view the hierarchy of the object.
