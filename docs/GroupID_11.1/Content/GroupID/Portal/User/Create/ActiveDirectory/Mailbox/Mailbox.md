# Create an AD Mailbox

You can create a mailbox using Directory Manager portal when a messaging provider has been configured for the identity store.

A mailbox is a user with a mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create Mailbox wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a mailbox in Active Directory

Step 1 –  In the Directory Manager portal, click the **Create New** button in the left pane and select  **Mailbox**.

The Create Mailbox wizard opens to the Account page.

Step 2 – On the [Account page](../Account "Account page"), specify basic account info, such as the object's first name, last name, login ID and the UPN suffix.

Step 3 – On the [Password page](../Password "Password page"), provide a password for the mailbox account and set other password-specific options.

Step 4 – On the [Exchange page](Exchange)"), set the alias and Office 365 subscriptions.

Step 5 – On the [Summary Page](../Summary "Summary Page"), review the settings and then click **Finish** to complete the wizard.

NOTE: If the Directory Manager administrator has specified the mailbox creation action for review, your changes will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the [Requests](../../../../Request/Overview) topic for additional information.
