# Expired Groups

This page lists expired groups. A group expires when:

* Its validity period, as defined in its expiration policy, ends.

  OR
* The administrator manually designates a group as expired.

Expired groups are locked for all activities until renewed.

You can [Modify Search Directory](AllGroups#modify "Modify Search Directory") to search expired groups and add [Filter All Groups](AllGroups#filter "Filter All Groups") by clicking **Expired Group Grid Filters**.
All the expired groups matching the filters will be displayed.
