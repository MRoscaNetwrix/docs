# Age (Min) Rule

The Minimum Age rule stops users from quickly cycling through a series of passwords in order to evade the History and Similarity rules. This rule can only be enforced by domain policies.

* Enable the **Age (Min)** button to enable the Minimum Age rule.

* Select the number of days before a user can change their password.

NOTE: The Minimum Age rule is unique because users cannot comply with it by choosing a different password; they must wait until the required number of days has elapsed.
