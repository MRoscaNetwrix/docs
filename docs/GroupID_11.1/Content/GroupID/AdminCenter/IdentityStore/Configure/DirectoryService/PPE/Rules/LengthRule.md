# Length Rule

The Length rule rejects passwords that contain too few or too many characters. Longer passwords are generally stronger, so only specify a maximum password length if password compatibility must be maintained with a system that cannot accept long passwords.

* Enable the **Length** button to enable the Length rule.
* Select one of the options

  * At least  characters – specify the minimum number of characters that passwords must contain. Choose the minimum number of characters from the drop-down list.
  * No more than  characters – specify the maximum number of characters that passwords can contain. Choose the maximum number of characters from the drop-down list.
  * Between  of  characters – specify the minimum and maximum number of characters that passwords can contain. Choose the minimum number of characters from the first drop-down list, and the maximum from the second drop- down list.
