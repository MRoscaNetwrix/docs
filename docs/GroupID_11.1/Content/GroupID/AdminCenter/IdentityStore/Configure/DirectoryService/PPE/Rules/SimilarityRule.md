# Similarity Rule

The Similarity rule rejects passwords that are similar to a user's current password. Password similarity may indicate that a user is serializing their passwords. For example, "password1", "password2", "password3". Password serialization allows an attacker to guess the new password.

* Enable the **Similarity** button to enable the Similarity rule.

* Current password – applies the similarity rules to the user's existing password.

* User display name – rejects passwords that are similar to a user's Active Directory display name (full name for local accounts).

* User logon name – rejects passwords that are similar to a user's logon name (user name).

For each option enabled, set the rules:

* Character substitution – Select the check box to reject passwords that rely on character substitution to comply with this rule.
* Words typed backward – Select the check box too additionally test passwords with their characters reversed. Enabling bi-directional analysis stops users from circumventing this rule by reversing the order of characters in their password. For example, a user may enter "drowssapdloym" instead of "myoldpassword".
* Tolerance – Select value to specify the maximum number of matching characters that Password Policy Enforcer allows before rejecting a password. For example, the two passwords "old**passwd**" and "new**passwd**" contain six consecutive matching characters (shown in bold type). Password Policy Enforcer rejects the new password if the tolerance is five (or lower), and accepts it if the tolerance is six (or higher).
