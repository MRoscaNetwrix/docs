# Create a Security Role

To create a security role for an identity store, you have to specify the following:

* Criteria - See [Criteria](Manage#Criteria "Criteria ").
* Priority - See [Priority](Manage#Priority "Priority").
* Permissions - Permissions refer to the different actions that role members can perform using Directory Manager, for example, creating directory objects, managing groups, managing scheduled jobs, managing user profiles,
  and more.
* Policies - Policies refer to settings that apply to role members. For example, the search policy limits role members to search for objects in a particular container.

You can create a role from scratch or by copying an existing role. See the [Security Roles](Overview "Security Roles") topic for additional information on security roles.

NOTE: You can disable a role to prevent its members from accessing Directory Manager. To prevent an individual role member from accessing Directory Manager, you must remove him or her from the group or container specified as role criteria.
