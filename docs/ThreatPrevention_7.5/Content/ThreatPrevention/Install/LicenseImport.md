# Import the License

Threat Prevention comes with a temporary 6-day license.

Follow the steps to import a license key file to continue using the product.

**Step 1 –** Contact your Netwrix Sales Representative and request for a license key.

**NOTE:** The .key file from sales must contain 'stealthintercept' in its name for Threat Prevention to recognize it and convert it to a .lic file.

**Step 2 –** Save the license key file to the following folder:

…\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager

![Import License](../../../../../static/images/ThreatPrevention_7.5/Content/Resources/Images/ThreatPrevention/ImportLicense.png "Import License")

**Step 3 –** The SIEnterpriseManager service automatically recognizes and imports the file.

**Step 4 –** (Optional) Restarting Enterprise Manager is often required after importing a new license key as that would stop the application from alerting about the expired license.

The license key has been successfully imported. The organization’s license information is available on the [License Manager Window](../Admin/Navigation/LicenseManager "License Manager Window").
