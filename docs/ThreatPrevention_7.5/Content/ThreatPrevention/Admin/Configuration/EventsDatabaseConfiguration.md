The Event database is originally configured when installing the Threat Prevention Enterprise Manager package. See the [Application Server Install](../../Install/Application "Application Server Install") topic for additional information. This window displays the current connection settings for the Event database.

Credentials and/or SQL Server host information can be changed in the DB Connection Manager application. See the [DB Connection Manager Wizard](../../Install/DBConnectionManager "DB Connection Manager Wizard") topic for additional information.
