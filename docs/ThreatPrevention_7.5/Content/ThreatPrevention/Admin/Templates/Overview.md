# Templates Interface

The Templates interface provides a list of all the pre-created policy templates in Threat Prevention. Click **Temaples** in the Navigation pane to launch the Templates interface.

The following is displayed for a template:

* Name
* Path – Location within the Navigation pane
* Description

The list of templates can be sorted alphanumerically ascending or descending by clicking on a column header. An arrow appears in the right corner of the column header indicating the type of sorting. You can also right-click a template to get a right-click menu.

Templates Node

Under the Templates node in the Navigation pane, folders are used to organize the templates. Folders can be created at the top level or as sub-folders since Threat Prevention supports unlimited levels for organizing templates. The pre-created templates are organized into multiple folders. See the [Pre-Created Templates](Folder/Overview "Pre-Created Templates") topic for additional information.

* Click a template to open it and view its configurations. See the [Template Configuration](Configuration "Template Configuration") topic for additional information.
* You can move a templates from one folder to another by dragging-and-dropping. This is a Move action.
* You can also drag a template into a folder under the Policies node. This would be a Copy action, and converts the template into a policy. See the [Use a Template to Create a Policy](CreatePolicy "Use a Template to Create a Policy") topic for additional information.

## Right-Click Menu

Each template listed in the Templates interface has a right-click menu. Select a template and right-click to open this menu.
