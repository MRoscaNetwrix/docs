# Test Passwords Window

The Test Password window enables users to test the password complexity requirements set in the [Password Rules Filter](../PasswordEnforcement#Password "Password Rules Filter") against a pending password. This window does not change a user’s password but allows pending user passwords to be tested in the domain.
