# SIEM Dashboards

Threat Prevention (formerly StealthINTERCEPT) can seamlessly integrate with all SIEM dashboards that a company is leveraging. For convenience, Netwrix has created a custom app for integration between Threat Prevention and three specific dashboards.

* IBM QRadar Integration
* Splunk Integration - Active Directory
* Splunk Integration - Threat Hunting

Additionally, you can also go to the [SIEM Output Viewer](../Admin/Configuration/SIEMOutputViewer "SIEM Output Viewer") window to view the data Threat Prevention sends to syslog (SIEM).
