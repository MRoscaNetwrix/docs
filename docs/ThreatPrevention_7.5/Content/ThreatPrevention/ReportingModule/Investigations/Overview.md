# Investigations Interface

The Investigation interface allows administrators to investigate all data available to the application through a series of customizable filters. These investigations can be saved so they can be run ad hoc at a later time.Click **Investigate** in the application header bar to open the Investigations interface.

If you have not integrated the Threat Manager Reporting module with a Netwrix product, the interface is displayed as:

![Investigations interface](../../../../../../static/images/ThreatPrevention_7.5/Content/Resources/Images/ThreatPrevention/Reporting/Investigations/Interface.png "Investigations interface")

To integrate with a Netwrix product, such as Threat Prevention, see the [Netwrix Integrations Page](../Configuration/Integrations/NetwrixIntegrations "Netwrix Integrations Page") topic.

After integration, when you click **Investigate** in the application header bar, the Investigations interface defaults to the New Investigation page as follows:
