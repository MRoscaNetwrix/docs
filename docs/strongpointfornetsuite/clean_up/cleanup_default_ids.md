2. Review each item to determine how they should be modified if their identifier is changed.
3. If you decide to change the __Script ID__, click or right click __Edit__ to open the customization record.
4. If you have a __Documentation and Optimization__ license:
   1. Change the __Script ID__.
   2. Click Save
   3. Click __ReSpider Now__
   4. Return to your results and review the next item.
5. If you have an __Intelligent Change Management__ license, open the __Change Management__ tab
6. __Create a Change Request__ or __Add to Change Request__ (there is a shortcut link to open the change request) to have all impacted customizations in the same change request and create a complete record of all changes implemented as a result of the IDÂ change.
7. Open your Change Request.
8. Review the __Impact Analysis__ tabs.
9. Continue with your normal Change Request process.
