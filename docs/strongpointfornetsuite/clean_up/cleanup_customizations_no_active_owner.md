# Clean Up Customizations with Inactive Owner

Ownership of the customizations is important for clean up and accountability in the system. Owners can become inactive if they quit using the system, or if their licenses have been marked [Inactive](../installing_strongpoint/managing_users.md). The report criteria excludes Customization types where owner does not apply.

1. Open __Strongpoint__ > __Clean Up__ > __Inactive Owner__
2. Click __Edit__ next to each Customization to change. You can right-click on __Edit__ and select Open link in a new tab or window to keep your results page available.
3. Select a new __Owner__.
4. Click __Save__

Using multi-line direct list editing does not update the actual customization record. Best practice is to edit the customization record so your changes are not overwritten during the next spider process.
