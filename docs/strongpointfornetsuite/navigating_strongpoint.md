# Navigation

There are two ways to access Platform Governance for NetSuite's functionality: the __Strongpoint__ tab on the NetSuite tab bar or from the __Strongpoint Overview__. Menu options are available based on your [License Type](installing_strongpoint/features_by_license_type.md). In addition, menu items can be hidden for each account through [Menu Management](installing_strongpoint/managing_menus.md). These examples show all the options for an __Enterprise Compliance__ license.

If you do not see the __Strongpoint__ tab, contact your Administrator regarding [Setting Tab Access](installing_strongpoint/setting_strongpoint_tab_access.md).
