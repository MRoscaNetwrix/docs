# SoD Testing Mode

Testing Mode helps you implement a new SoD solution, or to clean up your existing account. By creating and running rules in a test mode, you can identify and resolve potential issues with a rule without creating SoD incidents.

Testing Mode provides two ways to test a rule without generating SoD incidents:

- Test on Roles: checks to see if there are any roles violating the rule.
- Test on Employees: checks to see if any employees are violating the rule.

The violations list in Employee or Role customizations are updated during testing.

To access Testing Mode:

1. Create a new Rule or edit an existing Rule:  
   __SoD__ > __SoD Rule Library__ > __New__ or __Search__
2. Open the __SoD Rule Processing Status__ tab.
3. Select __Test on Roles__ or __Test on Employees__.
4. Click __Run SoD__Â to run the test. It can take over an hour to evaluate large accounts.

Any of these events require a role to be re-evaluated:

__Trigger Role Job__

- Anytime Role(s) are added/updated
- Anytime the Rules are added/updated
- Manual trigger on the Role

__Trigger Role Assignment__

- Anytime Role(s) are added/updated
- Anytime the Rules are added/updated
- Anytime Role Assignments on an Employee are added/updated
- Anytime Global Permissions are added/updated
- Also triggered when the Manual trigger on the Role is selected
- Manual Trigger on the Employee

You can manually start the evaluation process, or wait until the Spider runs overnight. To manually run the process:

1. Open __SoD__ > __SoD Processing Status__ > __Run SoD on User Roles__
2. Select all of the roles you have modified.
3. Click __Run SoD__

## Test Reports

Test Reports are available for both __User Role Test Violations__ and __Employee Test Violations__:
