# Accessing User Access Review

The User Access Review bundle must be [installed](/docs/strongpointfornetsuite/uar/install_app.md), and users must have NetSuite accounts and a UAR license to access User Access Review.

__User Access Review__ is available on the NetSuite menu bar if you have a [license](/docs/strongpointfornetsuite/uar/install_app.md#license). If it is not on your menu, contact your Netwrix or NetSuite administrator.
