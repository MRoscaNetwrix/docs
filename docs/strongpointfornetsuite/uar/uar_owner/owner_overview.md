# UAR Owner

Owners are set up by the UAR administrator to perform permission and/or membership reviews to assure they are appropriate:

- __Role Permission Review__: Review Permissions and Permission Levels granted within the Role

The [Owner User Access Reviews List](owner_uar_list.md) topic has details for accomplishing your reviews.

Owners are notified with an email message when a new review has been assigned. You can click one of the links in the email, or login to NetSuite and open [User Access Review](../access_app.md) to access the dashboard.
