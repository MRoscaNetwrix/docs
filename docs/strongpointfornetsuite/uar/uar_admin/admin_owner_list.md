# Owner List

Access your __Owner List__ from your menu bar. This is where Administrators can add or remove owners from reviews. All changes are captured in the [UAR History](/docs/product_docs/strongpointfornetsuite/uar/uar_history.md).

Auditors can view the Owner list and Owner notes, but cannot add or remove owners.

Here is an example of the __Owner List__:
