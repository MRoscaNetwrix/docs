# Finding Change Requests from Jira

To find your change requests that originated in Jira:

Create a Saved Search:

1. Open __Lists__ > __Search__ > __Saved Searches__ > __New__
2. Click __Change Request__
3. Best practice is to title the search something meaningful, such as __Find Change Requests from Jira__
4. You can add it to your dashboard, list view, reminders, or show it in your menu if you use this search frequently.
5. Add the filter:  
   __Originated system__  
   __is__  
   __Set by Jira__
6. Click __Preview__ to review your search.
7. __Save__ your Search.

The search runs when you save it. To run it in the future:

1. Open __Lists__ > __Search__ > __Saved Searches__
2. Select __View__ by your search.
