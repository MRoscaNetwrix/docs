# Creating a Change Request from a Case

If [Enable Case to Change Request Workflow](/docs/product_docs/strongpointfornetsuite/installing_strongpoint/installation_settings_report.md#Enable-Case-to-Change-Request-Workflow) is enabled, you can automatically create a Change Request directly from your Case:

1. Open __Lists__ > __Support__ > __Cases__.
2. __View__ a Case.
3. Click __Create Change Request__.

The Change Request is created, populating the fields specified in the [Case to Change Request Field Mapping](/docs/product_docs/strongpointfornetsuite/installing_strongpoint/installation_settings_report.md#Case-to-Change-Request-Field-Mapping) set up. The Change Request status is set to __Not Started__.

If the __Create Change Request__ button is not visible on the Case, the [Enable Case to Change Request Workflow](/docs/product_docs/strongpointfornetsuite/installing_strongpoint/installation_settings_report.md#Enable-Case-to-Change-Request-Workflow) is not enabled. Contact your system administrator.
