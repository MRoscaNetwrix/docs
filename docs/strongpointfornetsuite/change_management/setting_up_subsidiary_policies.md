# Setting Up Subsidiary Policies

Subsidiary Approval enables you to set subsidiary-specific policies based on the employees using a customization. Once an administrator sets up a change policy for a subsidiary, the subsidiary approvers are set for the process, and the process is attached to the policy. Subsidiary Processes are automatically created by the spider. Employees using customizations are evaluated and Employee subsidiaries and corresponding Subsidiary Processes are set to the customization.

To set up Subsidiary Approvals:

1. Open __Strongpoint__ > __Change Management Tools__ > __Change / Approval Policy__
2. __Edit__ the __Default Policy__.
3. Open the __Subsidiary__ tab.
4. Select one or more __Subsidiaries__.
5. Check __Require Subsidiary Process Approval__.
6. Save the __Policy__.
7. Open __Strongpoint__ > __Change Management Tools__ > __Change / Approval Policy__ > __New__ to create a new Subsidiary Specific Policy.
8. Enter a meaningful __Name__.
9. Select __Change Levels__ on the __Change Controls__ tab.
10. On the __Subsidiary__ tab, check __Require Subsidiary Process Approval__.
11. Click __Attach__ and add the policy to a subsidiary process.
12. __Save__ the policy. You are prompted to begin the approval process.
13. Enter a __Name__ and __Change Overview__ for the __Policy Change Approval__.
14. Click __In Progress__ in the status bar.
15. __Save__ the Approval.
16. Click __Edit__.
17. Select the __Approvers__ in the order to approve. Use Ctrl-click to select multiple approvers.
18. Save the Subsidiary Record.

When an object is attached to the change request, the Policy with the highest change level required is selected. All the Subsidiary approvers are included in the approval cycle.
