# Integration Records

Platform Governance for NetSuite documents your NetSuite integrations, creating an __Integration Record__ for each application. They are normally built and maintained by the Spiders. Changes to integration records are captured in Change Logs. The __Access Tokens/Integration Record__ Policy control assigns the level of change reporting.

Token-based authentication can be specified on the __Authentication__ tab. Use the __Customization Quick Search__ to locate an integration record.

The main section of the Integration Record summarizes the key information, including Application ID, name, description, state, and change history.

The __Authentication__ tab enables you to specify additional authorization for the integration:

When you make changes to this record, a change log is created. Here is an example:
