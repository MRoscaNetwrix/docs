# Customizations Overview

Customization records are documentation about each customization. They are automatically built and maintained by the Spiders. They enable you to search customizations and attach them to processes.

Customization records contain the following information:

1. What customizations exist (or used to exist) in an account.
2. Who is using the customizations.
3. Which customizations are being used.
4. What the joins are between customizations.
5. What detailed automated documentation exists, including search filters and formulas, related fields, scripts, searches and records.

For Change Management and Compliance, the joins between customizations are critical to determine the IT risk of making changes to the system. For example, they warn you if changing a search could break a workflow or a script.
