# User Management

These reports are available on the User Management Menu:

- __Employees with Standard Roles__ identifies all employees assigned to standard roles.
- __Employees with Unused Logins__ identifies any employees who have not logged in.
- __Employee Permission Changes__ identifies all permission changes that have occurred.
- __Unused Roles - Not Assigned__ identifies roles not assigned to any user.
- __Unused Roles - Assigned But Not In Use__ identifies roles assigned to a user, but never used.
- __Role Assignments with No Login in Six Months__ identifies assigned roles where a user has not logged in within the past six months.
- __Employees with Multiple Roles__ identifies users with multiple roles. Multiple roles create conflicts. Users who require multiple roles for support or administration can be isolated in a sandbox using Platform Governance for NetSuite to keep the sandbox the same as production for troubleshooting and support.
- __Current Global Permission__ identifies users with global permissions, which can cause conflicts. Best practice is to not use global permissions on a long-term basis.
