# Final Tasks

## Reviewing Critical and Non Critical Sheets

__Critical sheets__ include all customizations that make use of the bundle components. You should make sure you are aware of what these bundle components are doing and analyze the risks of removing them.
Specifically, you should review the customizations from scenarios 3 and 6:
Scenario 3: are non-bundle components that are used by bundle components, so there may be fields that are set by scripts, workflows or searches that belong to the bundle.
Scenario 6: are non-bundle components that use at least one bundle component for something, so their functionality and/or display may be broken.

__Non critical sheets__ include all the customizations from scenarios 1, 2, 4 and 5.

## Testing

Testing should occur in the sandbox environment first. Retest functionality after the bundle removal to ensure everything is working as expected. As part of the testing, run the [Comparing Environments](/docs/strongpointfornetsuite/change_management/comparing_environments.md) tool to see all the differences after the bundle removal (sandbox vs. production). It helps you determine what needs to be moved to the production environment.

After you remove the bundle from your production environment, run a post deployment check to make sure everything is the same between the sandbox and production environments.
