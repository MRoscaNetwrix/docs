# System Maintenance Period Error

Usually a _System Maintenance Period_ error indicates your primary web site in NetSuite is in maintenance mode, which blocks the display of all HTML content. If your web site is down for maintenance, you can resume using Platform Governance for NetSuite once your maintenance is complete and your web site is online again.

If the __Take Web Site Offline for Maintenance__ option is changed, you must use the __Strongpoint__ > __Strongpoint Support__ > __License Manager__ > __Get Lic. Number__  
 Or re-push the bundle to update the Spider link.

In most cases, if you are not using NetSuite web sites there is no impact on your system so you can do the following:

1. Open __Setup__ > Select __Site Builder__ > __Set Up Website__
2. Click __Edit__ for the Primary site.
3. Uncheck __Take Website Offline for Maintenance__
