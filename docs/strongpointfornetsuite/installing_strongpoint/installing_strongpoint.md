# Installing Platform Governance for NetSuite

To get Platform Governance for NetSuite up and running, you need to do the following:

1. [Install the bundle](#Install-the-bundle) using the correct bundle name and the bundle ID.
2. [Set the number of rows in list segments](#Set-the-number-of-rows-in-list-segments) to 1,000. This is a NetSuite best practice
3. [Assign a Strongpoint License](#Assign-a-Strongpoint-License).
4. [Run the spider](/docs/strongpointfornetsuite/installing_strongpoint/running_the_spider.md). The spider scans your account in a standardized manner. A series of scheduled scripts is run to document the connections between the customizations.

Starting with Version 6.2.5, queues and priority allocation are deprecated. The bundle is now installed using processor architecture for scheduled scripts. All deployments are set to low priority.

## Set the Number of Row in List Segments

It is important that you set your NUMBER OF ROWS IN LIST SEGMENTS to 1,000. This is a NetSuite best practice and critical for the proper spidering of your workflows.

2. Go to __Optimizing NetSuite__.
3. Set the value to __1,000__.
4. Click __Save__.

If the field is grayed out, it should be set as a __Company Preference:__

1. Select __Company Preferences__ from __Set Up__ > __General Preferences__ on the NetSuite main menu.
2. Find the field __Number of Rows in List Segments__
3. Set the value to __1,000__
