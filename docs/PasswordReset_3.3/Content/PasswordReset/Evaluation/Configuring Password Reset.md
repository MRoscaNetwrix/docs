The Configuration Console has a tabbed layout. Click the tabs along the top to see the various settings. Most of the settings are self-explanatory. Press **F1** on any of the tabs to see the help page for the current tab.

Configuration changes are applied when you click **Apply** or **OK**. Clicking **OK** also closes the Configuration Console.

**NOTE:** Password Reset includes a 30-day evaluation license for up to 50 users. Please [contact Netwrix support](mailto:support@netwrix.com) if you would like to evaluate Netwrix Password Reset with more than 50 users.
