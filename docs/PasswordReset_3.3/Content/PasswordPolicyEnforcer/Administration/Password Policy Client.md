# Password Policy Client

The Password Policy Client helps users to choose a compliant password. Detailed information is provided if their new password is rejected.

The Password Policy Client is optional. If it is not installed, the [Similarity Rule](Similarity Rule#_bookmark55 "Similarity Rule") can not be enforced. Users only see the default Windows error message if their password is rejected, not the detailed help they receive from the Password Policy Client.

The Password Policy Client displays the password policy during a password change so that users can see the policy while they choose their password. The Password Policy Client also displays a detailed rejection message to explain why a password was rejected. Both these messages are customizable.

**NOTE:** The Password Policy Client does not modify any Windows system files. It also does not send passwords or password hashes over the network.
