__NOTE:__ See [Endpoint Policy Managerand Workspace One (Airwatch) MDM: Deploy Group Policy and Endpoint Policy Manager superpowers today](/docs/policypak/policypak/video/mdm/workspaceone.md) for a video overview of Endpoint Policy Manager and VMware Workspace ONE MDM

__Step 1 窶点_ To use VMware Workspace ONE (formerly known as AirWatch) with Endpoint Policy Manager, use the Apps & Books section, and click __Add Application__ to add the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE MSI file, Endpoint Policy Manager license MSI file, and Endpoint Policy Manager settings MSI file.

__Step 3 窶点_ The Add Application Wizard should be run three times (not shown) in order to import each file. As you do, specify the following deployment options:

- Install Context should be set to __Device__.
- Install Command should have``` /ARPSYSTEMCOMPONENT=1``` added at the end of its field if you want to hide the MSI from the Control Panel.
- App Delivery Method should be set to __Auto__ so it becomes a forced installation .
- Assignment Groups can be __All Devices__ or __Targeted__, depending on what you need.
