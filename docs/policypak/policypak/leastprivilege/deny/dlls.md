# Denying DLLs within Applications

You can deny DLLs within Applications, like PowerShellâ€™s internal DLLs, which make it operate.

First you must turn on the option with a Global DLL policy, which may only be enabled on the
**Computer Configuration** side.

Then you can **Deny execution** of the DLL when it is encountered.

**NOTE:** Some additional details and examples can be found in the
