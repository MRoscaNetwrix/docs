# Understanding Re-authentication & Justification Text

There might be times you want users to re-authenticate and/or provide justification text about their actions. Justification text is logged to the local event log for later review.

Here, on the left youâ€™ll see a Self Elevate rule, and on the right a standard Elevation rule.

You can see both rule types have the options for __Require Justification Text__ and __Force user to reauthenticate__.

__NOTE:__ See the [Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager: Self Elevate Mode](/docs/policypak/policypak/video/leastprivilege/bestpractices/selfelevatemode.md) video for a demonstration of Justification text for Self Elevate.

__NOTE:__ See the [Endpoint Privilege: Re-Authenticate with Self Elevate](/docs/policypak/policypak/video/leastprivilege/selfelevatemode/reauthenticate.md) video for a demonstration of re-authentication for Self Elevate.

You can force a user to __Require Justification Text__ for normal elevation actions, as well as Self Elevate policies.

The following cases highlight how this might work.

## Case 1

__Show popup message__ is selected, but neither sub-option are checked.
