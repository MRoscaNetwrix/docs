# Elevating Java JAR Files

__NOTE:__ For an overview on elevating JAR files and also preventing .JAR files from running, which could need admin rights, see the [Elevate (or smack down) scripts and Java JAR files](../../video/leastprivilege/elevate/scripts.md) video.

You can use Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Least Privilege Manager to elevate a Java JAR file, or block it from running, in order to prevent attacks that originate over email or on USB flash drives.

To start making rules for Java JAR files right-click in the window and select __Add__ > __New Java (JAR) Policy__.
