In addition, you can use Endpoint Policy Manager's text based logs.

You will need admin access to see ```c:\ProgramData\PolicyPak\PolicyPak``` Device Manager logs.

Each log occurs when different policy triggering events occur. Special log is ppComputer_Operational.log which explains what's happening in real-time on the machine.
