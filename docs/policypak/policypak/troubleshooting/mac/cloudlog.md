# Understanding Cloud.log

Cloud.log contains actioned items from the policypakd.log file; processes that ran by the user and were either Allowed, Elevated or Blocked by Endpoint Policy Manager policies.

Please note, however, that to get a better understanding of how your policies are working, or not working, policypakd.log will give tell not only what processes were affected by policies, but also what processes weren’t – and may should have been.
