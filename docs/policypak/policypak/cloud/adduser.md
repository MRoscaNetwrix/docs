# How do I create a Secondary (or Accounting) contact within the Portal to enable another person to participate in Endpoint Policy Manager (including downloads, updates, etc.)?

__NOTE:__  This article pertains to portal.policypak.com.  If you need to manage users in the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud Portal (cloud.policypak.com) see [Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud: Adding New Admins](/docs/policypak/policypak/video/cloud/add/administrator.md)

There are three steps in the process:

__Step 1 –__ Your __Primary__ must log on to the Endpoint Policy Manager portal ([portal.policypak.com](https://portal.policypak.com/)).

__Step 2 –__ Click on __Your Contacts__ and then __Secondary__ to see who is secondary.

__Step 3 –__ You can then select __Invitation__ to send Invites to new Secondaries or Accounting people.

- Secondaries get technical AND renewal emails
- Accounting people get ONLY renewal emails

Finally, note that this does not add someone as another Endpoint Policy Manager CLOUD admin. That function is exclusively within the [CLOUD.policypak.com](https://cloud.policypak.com/) function.
