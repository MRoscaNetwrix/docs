# Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud Quick Start

Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Cloud is our system for delivering and enforcing Microsoft Group Policy and all Endpoint Policy Manager special settings to non-domain-joined, domain-joined on-prem, or remote machines. Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud enables machines to stay protected, regardless of where they are. It is comprised of separate components to enable you to control different types of settings. If you are in a hurry to get started, you can start with a web browser and one Windows 10 machine and see Endpoint Policy Manager immediately in action.
