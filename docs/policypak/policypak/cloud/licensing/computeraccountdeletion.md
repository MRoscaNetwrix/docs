# Computer Account Deletion

When a computer account is deleted, its acquired license is immediately returned back to the available license pool. To delete a computer, click on a group and go to the computer in the Computers section. Then, select __Delete computer__.

The computer account then goes to the __Deleted__ group. From there, you have two options:

- __Undelete__ - Returns the client back into the queue to acquire a license from the pool.
- __Delete permanently__ - Removes the record from Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud and, in addition, will send a signal to the client computer to uninstall both the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud MSI and Endpoint Policy Manager client-side extension (CSE) from the Windows machine (during the next connection).
