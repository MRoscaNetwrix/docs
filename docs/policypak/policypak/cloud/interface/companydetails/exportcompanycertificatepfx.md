# Export Company Certificate as .PFX

The "Export company certificate as .PFX" action enables you to export the certificate, which is typically embedded within the Endpoint Policy Manager Cloud client MSI to be exported. Typically there is no need to export the company certificate. However, exporting enables some advanced Cloud client installation scenarios if specified and directed by Endpoint Policy Manager Support.

__NOTE:__ If you perform the __Revoke Company Certificate__ action, any previously downloaded company certificate becomes invalid.
