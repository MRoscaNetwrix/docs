# Create Policy from Template

In 2019, Microsoft designed some security templates to be used on various types of workstations, which you can read about at the following link: [https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/04/11/introducing-the-security-configuration-framework-a-prioritized-guide-to-hardening-windows-10/](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/04/11/introducing-the-security-configuration-framework-a-prioritized-guide-to-hardening-windows-10/).

If you want to quickly implement these templates, you can use the __Create Policy from Template__ action.

Once selected, all the policies from that level are implemented, but are changeable.

Once saved, the policy is like any other XML data file.
