# Modes

If you used the Quick Start guides, you now have a feel for some of the special modes in Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager. Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager modes are available on a per-attribute basis, which provides for excellent flexibility when deciding which elements to configure, enforce, and even disable or hide.

__NOTE:__  To see an overview of the Enforcement modes, watch this quick tutorial video: [https://www.policypak.com/video/policypak-the-superpowers.html](http://tinyurl.com/screenshotpilot).

__NOTE:__ To see an overview of ACL Lockdown™ mode, watch this tutorial: [https://www.policypak.com/video/policypak-acl-lockdown-for-registry-based-applications.html](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3087759).

In Figure 22, you can see which modes are available when right-clicking a Endpoint Policy Manager Application Settings Manager attribute with settings data inside.

__NOTE:__ There is a special AppLock mode that you can apply to the entire tab to disable it. We'll discuss this in the "AppLock Modes" section.
