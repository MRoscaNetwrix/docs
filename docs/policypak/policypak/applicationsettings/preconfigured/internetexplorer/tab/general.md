Video: For a quick overview of how to manage the General tab using Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager
(formerly PolicyPak) Application Settings Manager, see the following video:

The General tab for IE can be seen in Figure 4.

One of the first special sections in the IE AppSet can set the Secondary Start Pages section, as
shown in Figure 5. This lets you configure specific secondary start pages when Internet Explorer
opens up. This section is always set to REPLACE. Entries here always overwrite what the user already
has in place.
