# Chrome: How do I block Local File access to Google Chrome with Endpoint Policy Manager?

Use the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Pak for Chrome. Then in the Extras, specify a URL to block as

three slashes after file like this.

```
file:///c:/
```

![38_1_image001](../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/policypak/policypak/applicationsettings/preconfigured/chrome/38_1_image001.jpg)

Result:

![38_2_image002](../../../../../../static/img/product_docs/policypak/policypak/applicationsettings/preconfigured/chrome/38_2_image002.jpg)
