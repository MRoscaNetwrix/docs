# Using the Helper Utility

In the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) File Associations Manager Quickstart examples, we recommended that your management station have the same applications as your target computers. However, that is not always practical. There are likely instances where you do not want to install an application on your machine just for the sake of making a File Association. For instance, someone in the Sales department may be the only one who has "Sales Application 123" installed.

That's where the Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager Helper utility comes in. Run the Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager Helper on an example endpoint with the application already installed and to which you want to make a policy association with later.

__NOTE:__ For a video overview demonstrating how to use the Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager Helper utility, watch this video: [Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager: Helper Application](/docs/policypak/policypak/video/fileassociations/helperapplication.md).

The Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager Helper is found in the Endpoint Policy Manager ISO or ZIP download in the Endpoint Policy Manager Extras folder.

__Step 3 窶点_ Select __Include icons in the file (Can dramatically increase file size)__. This setting is recommended even though the XML might be bigger. You must also choose to __Show file in folder after finished__ and __Open XML in Notepad when save is complete__ for examination.
