# Package Installation Policy

__NOTE:__ See the [Endpoint Policy Manager Least Priv Manager for Macs Application Package Support](../../video/leastprivilege/mac/applicationpackage.md) video for an overview of this section.

When a standard user attempts to install a .PKG file they are not allowed to do so. In this example, Skype for Business prompts the user for admin credentials before installing.
