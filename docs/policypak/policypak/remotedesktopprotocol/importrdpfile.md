## Importing an RDP File

If you already have existing RDP files configured and saved, you can import them.

![getting_to_know_policypak_6](../../../../static/img/product_docs/policypak/policypak/remoteworkdelivery/gettingstarted/getting_to_know_policypak_6.webp)

Then browse to the saved RDP file. Below you can see the imported path of the RDP file. Note that the file path setting was automatically imported, as are all other settings.
