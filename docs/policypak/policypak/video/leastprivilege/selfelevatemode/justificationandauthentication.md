# Remember Justification and Authentication

Want to set up number of runs (or number of hours) to keep justification & authentication
remembered? If you are using Self-Elevate, you can now specify how permissive or restrictive and how
often users must re-justify and re-authenticate. You can specify either number of times per hour or
the number of times executed to remember.

See this video for additional information.
