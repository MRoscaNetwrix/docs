# Troubleshooting ILT with the ILT Validator Tool

Use this tool to troubleshoot if a POLICY, COLLECTION or full ROOT with Collections and Policies
should apply or not to any particular machine or user.

**NOTE:** This tool only works when the Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) CSE is
installed on the machine you wish to perform ILT tests.
