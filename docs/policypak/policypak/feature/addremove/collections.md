# Getting Started with Collections

Endpoint Policy Manager Feature Manager for Windows policies may be contained in the root of the GPO, or within collections. We recommend that you start out by creating a collection that will contain the policies. If you put the policies in a collection, it will be easier to manage the settings.

Start out by going to __Add__ > __New Collection__. From there you can configure the collection settings.

The only item you might want to change regularly is the __Reboot Mode__. For now, change it to __Asks User__. In your own environment, you might want to select __Prevent__, but don't do this now.

You can see your collection added.
