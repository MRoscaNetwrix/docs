# The Mixed Rule Wizard Path

In the Quickstart, we went over the __Install Rule__ and __Uninstall Rule__. You might also want to check out the Mixed Rule. The __Mixed Rule__ wizard presents a combination of all the screens of __Install Rule__ and __Uninstall Rule__ along with all the screens for features and optional features.

We recommend first getting the hang of __Install Rule__ and __Uninstall Rule__. Once you get a better understand of the UI, you can start using the __Mixed Rule__.
