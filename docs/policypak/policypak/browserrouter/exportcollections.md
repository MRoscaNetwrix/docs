Choose a policy and select Export to XML.

__NOTE:__ Exported collections or policies maintain any Item-Level Targeting that is set. Endpoint Policy Manager Browser Router policies are always contained within collections, even if you export one single policy. In other words, a collection is automatically created at the time of export if you export a single policy.
