# Using Block Policies

You can block specific websites by making a rule and selecting the __Block__ website type. You can choose to provide __Block Text__, which will appear in a pop-up for the user, explaining why they cannot visit the website.

__NOTE:__ For an overview of using Block policies, see the following video: [Block web sites from opening in all browsers.](/docs/policypak/policypak/video/browserrouter/blockwebsites.md)

When you include text in the __Block Text__ field, the endpoint will react in all browsers with a pop-up like this one.

__NOTE:__ If you leave the __Block Text__ field empty, default text is automatically provided.
