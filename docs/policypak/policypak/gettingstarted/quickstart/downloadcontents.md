The result will be three more ZIP files like what is seen here.

__NOTE:__ Your ZIP file name(s) may be somewhat different.

Extract All against each ZIP and keep things organized. You may delete the ZIP files since you won’t need them past this point. The result will be three unpacked folders looking like this:.

__TIP__: For getting started you only need the software installation bits but don’t need the AppSets for Application Manager or Production-Guidance.

Now that everything is organized, you are ready to begin your installation.
