# Workflow Acceleration Schedule

A Workflow Acceleration schedule facilitates the workflow approver acceleration process for workflow
requests. This schedule is auto created when approver acceleration is enabled for the identity
store. See the [Workflow Approver Acceleration](/docs/groupid/11.1/groupid/admincenter/workflow/approveracceleration.md) topic for
additional information.

By default, the schedule runs daily to accelerate workflow requests to approvers, according to
workflow acceleration settings for an identity store and some predefined rules for approver
acceleration. It also generates notifications to inform approvers about pending workflow requests.

You cannot create or delete a Workflow Acceleration schedule; only update the existing one.

## Update the Workflow Acceleration Schedule

Follow the steps to update the Workflow Acceleration Schedule.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.

Step 2 – On the Identity Stores page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
**Edit**.

Step 3 – Click **Schedules** under Settings in the left pane.

Step 4 – On the Schedules page, click the plus sign next to Workflow Acceleration. Then click the
ellipsis button for the schedule and select **Edit**.

Step 5 – On the Edit Schedule page, the Schedule Name and Name Preview boxes display the name of the
schedule as read-only. The schedule is displayed with the name displayed for _Name Preview_ in email
notifications

Step 6 – In the Scheduler Service Name drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on the
number of nodes in all Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each node has its own Scheduler
service. See the [Scheduler Service](/docs/groupid/11.1/groupid/admincenter/service/schedulerservice.md) topic for additional
information.

Please note the following while selecting a Scheduler service:

- The Scheduler service for the Directory Manager instance on which you are creating the schedule is
  selected by default. However, you can select the Scheduler service of another instance as well.

- The Scheduler service can be changed even after creating the schedule. Upon the next run, the
  schedule will be triggered by the newly-selected Scheduler service.

- If the selected Scheduler service fails to trigger the schedule, then no other Scheduler service
  can be selected automatically.

- If a schedule is run manually on the Admin Center, then the Scheduler service of that instance
  will be used.

Step 7 – The Triggers area displays the default triggering frequency for the schedule.

- To change it, click **Edit** for it.
- To add a new trigger, click **Add Trigger**.

Follow step 11 in the
[Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
topic to manage triggers.

Step 8 – The Authentication area displays an account for running the schedule in the identity store.
To change it, click **Add Authentication**. Follow step 12 in the
[Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
topic for additional information.

Step 9 – Click **Update Schedule**.

Step 10 – On the Schedules page, click **Save**.  
For general schedule info, see the
[View the Schedules in an Identity Store ](manage.md#view-the-schedules-in-an-identity-store) topic
