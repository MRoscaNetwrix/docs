# Create a Data Source

You can create Synchronize jobs to synchronize data across different providers. As a prerequisite,
you must create data sources for those providers.

Data sources are primarily used in Synchronize jobs, but you can also use them in queries to search
for directory objects and in queries for group membership update.

## Create a Data Source for MS Excel

Create a data source for an Excel file to establish a connection before using it as a source or
destination in Synchronize jobs, or in queries. Directory Manager enables you to connect to an Excel
file that is placed on a local server or on OneDrive.

Synchronize supports Microsoft Excel (\*.xls | xlsx) to serve as both a source and destination
provider. Use it as destination in a Synchronize job to export data from a source to a new Excel
worksheet. The schema of the new Excel worksheet is automatically built according to fields that you
select from the source to map to the destination.

The Directory Manager Installer installs the required components for the MS Excel provider while
installing Directory Manager. However, if you experience any issue, make sure the following are
installed on the Directory Manager server:

- Microsoft Office 2007 or later
- Data connectivity components found at
  [Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920).

The Excel file for creating a data source can be placed on a local server or OneDrive. Follow the
steps in the respective section to create a data source.
