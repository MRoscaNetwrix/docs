# Prerequisites for Deployments in Docker

To deploy the Directory Manager applications in Docker, make sure you have a running instance of
Docker deamon in your environment.

## Directory Manager Applications for Docker

With every Directory Manager release, images for the following applications are pushed to Directory
Manager’s repository on Docker Hub:

- Directory Manager portal
- Data service
- Security service
- Admin Center

Images are akin to templates. You can pull an application image to Docker deamon and use it to
create a container for that application in Docker. Your application runs within this container.

For example, you can pull a Data service image from Docker Hub to Docker deamon and create a
container to deploy and run the service.

Image as template

Think of an image as a template. Run an image as many times as needed. On every run, a new container
is created in Docker, representing a new deployment of the same application.

## Docker Settings in the Configuration Tool

In Directory Manager, Docker-related configurations are managed using the Configuration Tool. These
include:

- Connectivity with Docker Hub
- Creating the default Data service
- Creating the default Security service

### Specify Repository Info

To connect with Docker Hub, provide the name of the Directory Manager repository on Docker Hub.
Images for the Directory Manager applications are publicly available here:

On pulling an image, you are prompted to provide your Directory Manager license. Enter a valid
license to deploy the application in Docker.

### Service Deployment (Optional)

Using the Configuration Tool, you can choose to deploy the default Data service and Security service
in Docker or native IIS.

To proceed with a Docker deployment, provide a container name, a port number, and the Docker Engine
URL for Data service and then for Security service. The Configuration Tool creates a container for
each service in Docker deamon and runs the service from within that container.

## Images and Containers in Docker Desktop

In Docker Desktop, you can view the images available in the remote repository (Docker Hub), the
images that you have pulled, and the containers created (the applications running in Docker).

### Images

Launch Docker Desktop and click **Images** in the left pane.

The Images page (Local tab) shows all images that you have pulled from different repositories.
Notice the first image is from Directory Manager. Here:

- **Imanami** is the repository name.
- **gid-selfservice** is the Directory Manager application name.
- **Tag** is the Directory Manager version.

Click **Remote Repositories** to go to the remote server, where you will find all Directory
Manager-specific images under _Imanami_.

Directory Manager application images for different Directory Manager versions are listed here. For
example, three Data service images are available for three distinct Directory Manager versions.

Hence, multiple images for an application are available in Docker Hub, each linked to a different
Directory Manager version. Based on the Directory Manager version you install, the corresponding
images will be pulled from Docker Hub and deployed in Docker.

### Containers

On the **Images page – Local** tab, you can manually run an image to create a container for
deploying the application.

Click **Containers/Apps** in the left pane to view the containers.

Select a container and click **Inspect** to view its details.
