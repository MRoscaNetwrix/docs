# Create an AD Mailbox

You can create a mailbox using GroupID portal when a messaging provider has been configured for the
identity store.

A mailbox is a user with a mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create Mailbox wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the
administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

changes will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the
