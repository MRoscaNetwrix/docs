# Security Service

Admin Center lets you quickly create and deploy a Security service. This web-based service is a
single sign-on implantation for GroupID clients. It is responsible for authenticating and
authorizing users on different GroupID clients and functionalities in accordance with their roles.
The service also encrypts and decrypts data that Data service stores and fetches from the GroupID
database on SQL Server.

You can create multiple Security services; the default service is created while configuring GroupID.

## The Default Security Service

See [Data Service](/docs/groupid/11.0/groupid/admincenter/service/dataservice/overview.md)
topic.

## Why Create Multiple Security Services?

See the
[Why Create Multiple Data Services?](/docs/groupid/11.0/groupid/admincenter/service/dataservice/overview.md#why-create-multiple-data-services)
topic while replacing references to Data service with Security service.
