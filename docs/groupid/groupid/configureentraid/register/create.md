- The __Basics__ tab contains the core fields required to create a new user.

  - __User principal name__: Enter a unique username and select a domain from the menu after the @ symbol. Select __Domain not listed__ if you need to create a new domain. For more information, see [Add your custom domain name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/add-custom-domain).
  - __Mail nickname__: If you need to enter an email nickname that is different from the user principal name you entered, uncheck the __Derive from user principal name__ option, then enter the mail nickname.
  - __Display name__: Enter the user's name.
  - __Password__: Provide a password for the user to use during their initial sign-in. Uncheck the __Auto-generate password__ option to enter a different password.
  - __Account enabled__: This option is checked by default. Uncheck to prevent the new user from being able to sign-in. You can change this setting after the user is created.

  Either select the __Review + create__ button to create the new user or __Next: Properties__ to complete the next section.
- The __Properties__ tab has some categories of user properties you can provide. These properties can be added or updated after the user is created. The properties are:

  - __Identity__: Enter the user's first and last name. Set the User type as either Member or Guest.
  - __Job information__: Add any job-related information, such as the user's job title, department, or manager.
  - __Contact information__: Add any relevant contact information for the user.
  - __Settings__: Specify the user's global location.

  Either select the __Review + create__ button to create the new user or __Next: Assignments__ to complete the next section.
- The __Assignments__ tab. You can assign the user:

  - an administrative unit
  - group(s), select a group if you want to add the user to one or more existing groups
  - role(s), assign the user a Global administrator role  
    Members of this role can create/manage groups, create/manage groups settings like naming and expiration policies, and view groups activity and audit reports.

  Select the __Review + create__ button.

By default, the Directory Manager Administrator security role in a Microsoft Entra ID identity store binds to Global Administrator. If minimum role assignment for the service account is used, the default Admin Security role criteria should also be changed to the User Account Administrators group.

The user is created and added to your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

You can now create an identity store for Microsoft Entra ID in Directory Manager.

Make sure you copy the application ID which is generated by Microsoft Entra ID when the application is registered. This application ID will be required while creating an identity store for Microsoft Entra ID.
