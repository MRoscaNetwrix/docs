# Notifications

Directory Manager generates email notifications whenever certain events are triggered. The notifications are sent to administrators, object owners and other specified recipients.

To enable notifications, you must define an SMTP server for an identity store. Admin Center and the Directory Manager portal, use the SMTP server for the respective identity store to send email notifications.

Templates for all kinds of email notifications are predefined in Directory Manager. These are available in different languages, enabling you to customize a notification template for any language.

Since notification templates are global and work for all identity stores, any customization to a template would change that notification for all identity stores.

Directory Manager also features an email service that maintains a queue of all notification requests generated by different identity stores, and sends them one by one. This is especially helpful when the SMTP server for an identity store is down, as notifications
stay in the queue until they are delivered when the SMTP server is up again.
