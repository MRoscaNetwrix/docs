# Unique Characters Rule

The Unique Characters rule rejects passwords that do not contain a minimum number of unique characters. For example, the password "aaaaaaaa" only contains one unique character (a), whereas "mypassword" contains nine unique characters (mypasword). Increasing the number of unique characters in a password increases password strength by avoiding repetitive sequences that are easily guessed. The Unique Characters rule is case sensitive, so "LoOpHole" contains seven unique characters (LoOpHole).
