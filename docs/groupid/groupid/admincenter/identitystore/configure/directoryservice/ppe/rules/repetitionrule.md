# Repetition Rule

The Repetition rule rejects passwords that contain excessive character or pattern repetition. Reducing repetition increase resistance to both brute-force and dictionary cracking algorithms. The Repetition rule is not case sensitive, so "mypaSssSword" contains four consecutive repeating characters (SssS).

- Enable the __Repetition__ button to enable the repetition rule.

- Reject repetition `<_character_>` and more consecutive characters like "aaaA" – Select the option and set the maximum number of consecutive repeating characters that passwords can contain.

- Reject repetition like "wordword" or "p@$s\_p@$s" – Select the option to enable pattern repetition.

- Detect character substitution – Select if Password Policy Enforcer should reject passwords that rely on character substitution to comply with this rule.

- Bi-directional analysis – Select if Password Policy Enforcer should additionally test passwords with their characters reversed. Enabling this analysis stops users from circumventing this rule by reversing the order of characters in their password. For example, a user may enter "edcba" instead of "abcde".

- Tolerance – Choose a value from the drop-down list to specify the longest pattern that Password Policy Enforcer allows before rejecting a password. For example, the password "password__wxyz__" contains a four-character pattern. Password Policy Enforcer rejects this password if the tolerance is set to three (or lower), and accept it if the tolerance is set to four (or higher).
