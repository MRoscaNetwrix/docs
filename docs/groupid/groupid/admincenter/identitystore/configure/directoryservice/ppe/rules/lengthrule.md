# Length Rule

The Length rule rejects passwords that contain too few or too many characters. Longer passwords are generally stronger, so only specify a maximum password length if password compatibility must be maintained with a system that cannot accept long passwords.

- Enable the __Length__ button to enable the Length rule.
- Select one of the options

  - At least `number of` characters – specify the minimum number of characters that passwords must contain. Choose the minimum number of characters from the drop-down list.
  - No more than `number of` characters – specify the maximum number of characters that passwords can contain. Choose the maximum number of characters from the drop-down list.
  - Between `number` of `number` characters – specify the minimum and maximum number of characters that passwords can contain. Choose the minimum number of characters from the first drop-down list, and the maximum from the second drop- down list.
