# Compromised Rule

The Compromised rule rejects passwords from prior breaches. These passwords should not be used as they are vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks.

- Enable the __Compromised__ button to enable the Compromised rule.

- Type path to your compromised passwords base files into the text box. The path can contain environment variables like %SystemRoot%.

  __CAUTION:__  Using shared hash files degrades performance, and could jeopardize security.
