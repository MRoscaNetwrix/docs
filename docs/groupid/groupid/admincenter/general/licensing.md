    - __Group Management license__: enables you to manage identical groups in the linked identity store(s) and auto sync them.

NOTE: Licenses for certain add-ons are dependent on other licenses, such as the Group Attestation license is dependent on the Group Usage Service license, which in turn is dependent on the Group Management license.

What happens when your license expires

When a license expires, its respective functions get read-only but you can configure certain settings, such as create identity stores, create data sources, and define replication settings. Moreover, unlicensed functions are displayed with a yellow icon next to them. On hovering the mouse over the icon, a message is displayed with two buttons: __Learn more__ and __Upgrade__. Both buttons redirect you to the [Group and User Management Software from Netwrix](https://www.netwrix.com/group_and_user_management_software.html) page, where you can learn more about Directory Manager and purchase or renew your Directory Manager licenses.
