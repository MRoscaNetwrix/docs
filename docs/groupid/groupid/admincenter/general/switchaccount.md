# Switch Accounts

You do not need to sign out of Admin Center or a portal in order to sign in with a different account. Simply use the _switch account_ function to achieve this.

## Switch your account

1. In Admin Center or a portal, click your name in the top right corner and select __Switch Account__. The next page lists the accounts you have
   used to sign into Admin Center and any of the portals.
2. Do one of the following:
   - Click an account to access Admin Center/the portal with it, without having to provide the password.
   - Click __Login as a different user__ to sign in with an account not listed on this page.
   - Click __Logout completely__ to sign out of all the accounts listed on this page.
