# Synchronize Schedule

The Directory Manager scheduling function enables you to set any Synchronize job or job collection
to run automatically. Create a Synchronize schedule and add Synchronize jobs and job collections as
targets. When the schedule runs, the target jobs and job collections are executed.

## Create a Synchronize Schedule

Follow the steps to create a Synchronize Schedule.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click **Identity Stores** in the left pane.

Step 2 – On the Identity Stores page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select
**Edit**.

Step 3 – Click **Schedules** under Settings in the left pane.

Step 4 – On the Schedules page, click **Add Schedule** and select **Synchronize Job**. The Create
Schedule page is displayed.

Step 5 – In the Schedule Name box, enter a name for the schedule.

Step 6 – The Name Preview displays the schedule name prefixed with \_SynchronizeJobPortal\_\_; the
schedule is displayed with this name in email notifications.

Step 7 – In the Scheduler Service Name drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on the
number of nodes in all Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each node has its own Scheduler
service. See the [Scheduler Service](../service/schedulerservice.md) topic for additional
information.

Please note the following while selecting a Scheduler service:

- The Scheduler service for the Directory Manager instance on which you are creating the schedule is
  selected by default. However, you can select the Scheduler service of another instance as well.

- The Scheduler service can be changed even after creating the schedule. Upon the next run, the
  schedule will be triggered by the newly-selected Scheduler service.

- If the selected Scheduler service fails to trigger the schedule, then no other Scheduler service
  can be selected automatically.

- If a schedule is run manually on the Admin Center, then the Scheduler service of that instance
  will be used.

Step 8 – Add a Synchronize job or a job collection or both to this schedule.

- Click **Add Jobs** to add a Synchronize job to this schedule. The Select Jobs to Add dialog box
  displays Synchronize jobs. Select one or more jobs and click **Add**.
- Click **Add Job Collection** to add a Synchronize job collection to this schedule. The Select Job
  Collections to Add dialog box displays job collections from Synchronize. Select one or more job
  collections from the list and click **Add**.

The selected job(s) and job collection(s) are listed in the Target(s) area. They will be executed
when the schedule runs.  
To remove a job or job collection in the Target(s)area, click **Remove** for it.  
To remove all target objects, click **Remove All**.

Step 9 – Click **Add Triggers** in the Triggers area to specify a triggering criterion for the
schedule, that, when met, starts the execution of the schedule. Follow step 11 in the
[Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
topic to add triggers.

Step 10 – Click **Add Authentication** in the Authentication area to specify an account for running
the schedule in the identity store. Follow step 12 in the
[Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](groupusageservice.md#create-a-group-usage-service-schedule)
topic for additional information.

Step 11 – On the Create Schedule page, click **Create Schedule**.

Step 12 – On the Schedules page, click **Save**.  
The schedule is displayed under **Synchronize**. See the
[View the Schedules in an Identity Store ](manage.md#view-the-schedules-in-an-identity-store) topic
for additional information.
