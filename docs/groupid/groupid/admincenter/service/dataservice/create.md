# Create a Data Service

You can create a Data service in native IIS, remote IIS, and Docker.

## Create a Data Service in Native IIS

When you deploy a Data service in native IIS, Directory Manager does the following:

- It creates a directory with the Data service’s name at the following physical path on the Directory Manager server, and copies the service files from its template directory to the new service directory:

  ```X:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 11.0\GroupIDDataService\Inetpub\```

  (X represents the Directory Manager installation drive)
- It also creates a virtual directory for the service in your desired IIS site.

The Data service runs within a virtual directory in IIS while the service files are physically located on disk.

Follow the to create a Data service.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click __Applications__ in the left pane.

Step 2 – Click __Add Application__.

Step 3 – On the next page, select __Data Service__ and click __Next step__.

Step 4 – On the Create Directory Manager Application page, make sure the __IIS__ tile is selected.

Step 5 – In the Application Name box, enter a unique name for the service or use the default name. The service is displayed with this name in Directory Manager.

Step 6 – In the Deployment Name box, enter a deployment name for the service.  
The application name and deployment name are displayed on the service card. It is as:

Step 7 – In the IIS Application Name box, enter an IIS deployment name for the service. The name should be unique for each Data service deployed in IIS.   
The IIS application name is used to name the service’s directory in IIS and its physical directory under ```X:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 11.0\GroupIDDataService\Inetpub\``` on the Directory Manager server.  
(X represents the Directory Manager installation drive)

Step 8 – In the __IIS Site__ drop-down list, select a website to host the service files.  
The list displays the websites defined on the local IIS server. GroupIDSite11 is the default
selection.

Step 9 – In the Service Endpoints area, bind an Elasticsearch service, Replication service, and Scheduler service with the Data service.

1. In the Elasticsearch Service drop-down list, select an Elasticsearch service to bind to this Data service.  
   The list displays the Elasticsearch services running in the environment. Requests sent to the Data service for performing a search in the Elasticsearch repository will be carried out through the Elasticsearch service you select here.
2. On selecting an Elasticsearch service, the Replication Service drop-down list displays the Replication services running on the same machine as the Elasticsearch service. Select a Replication service to bind to this Data service.  
   When a user force runs the replication service (whether globally or for a specific identity store), a request is sent to the Data service, that is then passed on to the Replication service bound to that Data service.
3. In the Scheduler Service drop-down list, select a scheduler service to bind to this Data service. The number of services displayed in the list depends on the number of nodes in Directory Manager clusters, as each node has its own Scheduler service.   
   This Data service will send requests to the selected Scheduler service to trigger schedule runs.

Step 10 – Click __Create Application__.  
The Data service is created and displayed on the Data Service tab.

## Create a Data Service in Remote IIS

You can deploy a Data service within a site in remote IIS. For this, you need to connect with the Microsoft IIS Administration API running on the remote IIS machine.

When you create a Data service in remote IIS, Directory Manager does the following:

- It creates a virtual directory for the service in a preconfigured site in remote IIS.
- It creates a physical directory for the service in the folder that is mapped to this preconfigured site.

The Data service runs within a virtual directory in remote IIS while the service files are physically located on disk.

To learn about the remote IIS settings and configurations before deploying a service there, see the
[Prerequisites for Deployments in Remote IIS](/docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/portal/remoteiisprerequisites.md) topic.

Follow the steps to create a Data service.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click __Applications__ in the left pane.

Step 2 – Click __Add Application__.

Step 3 – On the next page, select __Data Service__ and click __Next step__.

Step 4 – On the Create Directory Manager Application page, select the __Remote IIS__ tile.

Step 5 – In the Application Name box, enter a unique name for the Data service or use the default name. The Data service is displayed in Directory Manager with this name.

Step 6 – In the Deployment Name box, enter a deployment name for the service. The application name and deployment name are displayed on the service card.

Step 7 – To enter information for API URL, Access Token, Username, Password, IIS Application Name, and Website, refer to steps 7-11 in the [Create a Portal in Remote IIS](/docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/portal/create.md#create-a-portal-in-remote-iis) topic. Replace any reference to the portal with the Data service.

Step 8 – For entering information in the Service Endpoints area, follow steps 9 in the [Create a Data Service in Native IIS](#Create-a-Data-Service-in-Native-IIS) topic.

Step 9 – Click __Create Application__.  
The new Data service is displayed on the Data Service tab.

## Create a Data Service in Docker

Directory Manager enables you to deploy a Data service in Docker. For this, you need to connect with the API running on a Docker deamon in your environment, so that Directory Manager can create a container for the service there and run the service from within that container.

For an overview on application deployment in Docker, see
the [Prerequisites for Deployments in Docker](/docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/portal/dockerprerequisites.md) topic.

NOTE: 
To host the Data service, Docker daemon should be configured to run Windows containers.

Follow the steps to create a Data service.

Step 1 – In Admin Center, click __Applications__ in the left pane.

Step 2 – Click __Add Application__.

Step 3 – On the next page, select __Data Service__ and click __Next step__.

Step 4 – On the Create Directory Manager Application page, select the __Docker__ tile.

Step 5 – In the Application Name box, enter a unique name for the Data service or use the default name. The Data service is displayed in Directory Manager with this name.

Step 6 – In the Deployment Name box, enter a deployment name for the service. The application name and deployment name are displayed on the service card.

Step 7 – To enter information for Port, Service URL, and Container Name, refer to steps 7-9 in the [Create a Portal in Docker](/docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/portal/create.md#create-a-portal-in-docker) topic. Replace any reference to the portal with the Data service.

Step 8 – For entering information in the Service Endpoints area, follow step 9 in the [Create a Data Service in Native IIS](#Create-a-Data-Service-in-Native-IIS) topic.

Step 9 – Click __Create Application__.  
The Data service is created and displayed on the Data Service tab.
