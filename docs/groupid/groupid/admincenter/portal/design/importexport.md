# Specify Attributes for Import/Export of Group Owners and Members

In the Directory Manager portal, users can:

- Export members and additional owners of a group to a file, such as a csv or an xls file
- Import members and additional owners for a group from a file. Members can also be imported from an external data source.

You can specify schema attributes to be used for export/import, along with a user-friendly name for each attribute.

- The import function reads the objectsâ€™ information from an external file or data source and searches for matching objects in the directory based on field mapping (where a column name in the file or data source is mapped to any of the attributes specified here).  
  Objects having the same values for the mapped fields are added to the membership or additional ownership of the target group.
- The export function reads the membership/additional ownership of the group and exports the values of the specified attributes for members/additional owners to an external file.

The schema attributes you specify are displayed with their user-friendly names on the following wizards in the portal:

| Wizard Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Import Members | This wizard is used to import members to a group using a file or an external data source.  Users can launch it from the Members page on the Create Group wizard and from the Members tab in group properties. |
| Export Members | This wizard is used to export the members of a group to an external file.  Users can launch it from the Members tab in group properties. |
| Import Additional Owners | This wizard is used to import additional owners to a group using an external file.  Users can launch it from the Owners page on the Create Group wizard and from the Owner tab in group properties. |
| Export Additional Owners | This wizard is used to export the additional owners of a group to an external file.  Users can launch it from the Owner tab in group properties. |

NOTE: The attributes you specify apply to all four wizards. You cannot specify a different set of attributes for a wizard.
