# Linked Combo Type - Schema

On the __Schema__ page of the __Linked Combo Display Type__ wizard, define the parent-child relationship between fields. Every linked field must have a parent field except the primary parent field. Each linked field also requires a data binding expression
that defines its mapping with the underlying XML data. Directory Manager provides a list of all possible data binding expressions (extracted from the XML source file) to select from.

Do the following:

1. Map the __Type binding expression__ list to the first worksheet (0-<worksheet name>) of the source Excel workbook. The portal fields use the binding expression to obtain reference to the worksheet in the
   source file to retrieve and display data from.  
   Expressions in the __Type binding expression__ list are auto generated with respect to the number of sheets in the source Excel workbook and the number of columns in a sheet. It is as:

   In an expression, worksheet names are enclosed in brackets while the names of the data columns in the worksheets are without brackets. The expressions in the figure above indicate that
   the Excel workbook has three worksheets: _Company_, _Country_, and _City_.

   - The _Company_ worksheet has one data column: _Name_.
   - The _Country_ worksheet has two data columns: _Name_ and _State_.
   - The _City_ worksheet has four data columns: _Name_, _Address_, _Address2_, and _ZipCode_.
2. Use the grid on the __Schema__ page to link and relate the data from the Excel workbook sheets to the portal fields.

   1. Click __Add__ to add a row.

   2. In the __Linked Field__ drop-down list, select a field (for example, Country). This field will be linked to the data column represented by the binding expression you select in the __Binding Expression__ drop-down list.  
      The __Linked Field__ list contains predefined, hard coded fields, where each field is already mapped to a schema attribute. When you map a field to an expression, the values in the worksheet’s data
      column will be available for the field in the portal. When a portal user selects a value, it is set as the attribute’s value for the field.
   3. The __Parent Field__ list does not apply to the first row. For all other rows, use it to select the name of the parent field for the selected linked field. For example, when _State_ is selected in the _Linked Field_ list, select Country as the parent field.
   4. In the __Binding Expression__ drop-down list, select an expression that represents the data column you want to link to the field selected in the __Linked Field__ list.  
      Expressions are auto generated with respect to the number of sheets in the source Excel workbook and the number of columns in a sheet, as shown in the figure above.

   The following example shows the relationship for an Excel workbook with three worksheets: 0-Company, 1-Country, and 2-City. (You can also create two linked combos to manage the relationship between these three fields.)

   ![schema](/static/img/product_docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/schema.png)

   The relationship formed between fields can be explained as:

   - The Company field, containing all records from the Name column on the Company worksheet, will be the primary linked combo field in the portal.
   - The Country field in the portal will contain all records from the Name column on the Country worksheet.
   - The State field in the portal will contain all records from the State column on the Country worksheet. The Country field will be the parent field for the State field, which means that when a user selects a country, the State field will show
     the states in that country.
   - The City field in the portal will contain all records from the Name column on the City worksheet. The State field will be the parent field for the City field, which means that when a user selects a state, the City field will show the cities
     in the selected state.

   The complete structure for the data in the Excel workbook is explained in the following table.

   | Worksheet | Column | Description | Example |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | 0-Company | ID | Company identifier | 1000  2000 |
   | Name | Company name | Netwrix Consulting  Netwrix Software |  |
   | 1-Country | FK | Company identifier with which to link this record | 1000  2000 |
   | ID | Country identifier | 1010  2010 |  |
   | Name | Country name | United States  Pakistan |  |
   | State | State abbreviation | CA  PU |  |
   | 2-City | FK | Country identifier with which to link this record | 1010  2010 |
   | ID | City identifier | 1011  2011 |  |
   | Name | City name | Livermore  Lahore |  |
   | Address | Office address 1 | 5099 Preston Ave  T8-A, Gulberg |  |
   | Address2 | Office address 2 |  |  |
   | Zip Code | Postal zip code or area code | 94551  54600 |  |
