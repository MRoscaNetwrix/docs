# Linked Combo Type - Details

Enter the following details about the linked combo on the __Details__ page of the __Linked Combo Display Type__ wozard:

1. Enter a name for the linked combo in the __Linked Combo Name__ box.  
   You cannot change the name of a custom display type once you have created it.
2. Next, specify the data source for the linked combo. You can either use an already uploaded file or upload a new one.

   - Use the __Available Data Sources__ drop-down list to select an already uploaded file. This may be required, for example, when your source file contains the data and relationships
     for several fields, and you want to manage those relationships using multiple linked combos rather than one combo. Hence the need to upload the same file for multiple linked combos.  
     The list displays all the data source files previously used to create linked combos for this portal. To export a file, select it and click __Export__. The file is saved to the download location set in your browser settings.
   - To upload a new file, click __Browse__ next to the __File Name__ box and select the XML or Microsoft Excel file containing the data to populate the linked combo and the display types linked to it.

   If the source file is a Microsoft Excel (.xls or .xlsx) file, Directory Manager automatically creates its XML version to process it. To learn about the Excel file format, see the [Excel Data File Format](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/portal/linkedcombo/fileformat.md) topic.
3. Click __Next__.
