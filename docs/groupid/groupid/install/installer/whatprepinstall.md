Microsoft ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle 8.0.8   Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-6.0.30-windows-hosting-bundle-installer) to download. | Directory Manager runs on Microsoft .NET 6.

| Visual C++ |  |
| Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable Tool |  |
| Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime |  |
| Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator | The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator service (MSDTC) is installed during the installation of the Windows OS. Errors that occur during installation may stop the component from working properly. Any errors that occur during an upgrade process may also stop the component from working properly  More information:   [Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator Service Installation and Setup](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd353812%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) |
| Elasticsearch 8.0.0 | If 95% of space is consumed on C drive, Elasticsearch will stop responding intermittently and will require a restart after more than 95% space is available.  When Elasticsearch is locked, any object created or modified in Directory Manager will be committed in the provider but not in the Elasticsearch repository.  While configuring an Elasticsearch cluster on all Directory Manager Instances, make sure that port TCP IP 9305 or a custom port (configured in the yml file for the Elasticsearch cluster) is unblocked and remains the same on each Directory Manager instance that is part of the master-slave cluster.  If you do not want to use this version of Elasticsearch, select the __I will install and manage Elasicsearch myself__ option on the Elasticsearch Settings page of the Configuration Tool. |
| Exchange Online Management Module | Required for Microsoft Entra ID |
| WinRM IIS Extension | For Directory Manager to make a connection to Exchange, configure WinRM in one of the following ways.   - __Option 1: intra-Domain__  Both Directory Manager and the destination Exchange host must be in the same domain. Both systems must have WinRM configured (use the PowerShell command winrm /quickconfig for this). The default value for the necessary listener(s) is \* and that is all that is necessary to make a remote connection when the “–authentication” parameter is not specified. - __Option 2: Inter-Domain__  Both systems must have WinRM configured (use the PowerShell command winrm /quickconfig for this). Design the hosts to trust each other by configuring “Trusted Hosts” either by GPO or locally.    - By GPO — Computer > Windows > Admin Templates > Windows Components > Windows Remote Management > WinRM Client > Trusted Hosts   - Use this PowerShell command to configure locally:  Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts –Value <servername.domain.com> |
