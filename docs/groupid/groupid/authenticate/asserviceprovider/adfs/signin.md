# Sign In Using AD FS

We configured the ADS FS provider with a Directory Manager client, that is the Directory Manager portal _Wizard_ in our example. For single sign-on using AD FS, we can choose any of the following ways:

- SP-initiated single sign-on - when the SSO operation is initiated from the SP end, i.e., from the Directory Manager portal, Wizard.
- IdP-initiated single sign-on - when the SSO operation is initiated from the IdP end, i.e., from AD FS.

### SP-Initiated Single Sign-On

Step 1 – Launch the Directory Manager portal _Wizard_.  
On the Login page, the availability of the user name and password fields depends on whether you disabled Directory Manager Authentication or not (see step 2 in the [Specify Advanced Configurations](configureadfsingroupid.md#specify-advanced-configurations) topic).  
The AD FS option may be displayed as a button or an image.

Step 2 – Click the AD FS button or image; you will be redirected to the AD FS authentication page with the URL you provided as the IDP login URL (see the [Provide IDP Login URL](configureadfsingroupid.md#provide-idp-login-url) topic).

Step 3 – Sign in as an Active Directory regular user. On signing in, the authentication is routed to AD FS, that will validate the user with respect to the specified attribute (i.e., user principal name – UPN in our case) and log him or her into the Directory Manager portal.

With single sign-on, you can now launch any Directory Manager client without having to sign in again.

### IdP-Initiated Single Sign-On

Step 1 – Launch the ADF FS portal using the URL provided by your organization and sign in. The AD FS dashboard will be displayed.

Step 2 – From the Sign in to one of the following sites list, select a relying party trust. This list contains the relying party trusts configured with AD FS for single sign-on.

Step 3 – Click __Sign in__; you will be redirected to it. Authentication will not be required.
