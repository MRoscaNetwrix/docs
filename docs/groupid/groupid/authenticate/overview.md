# Authenticate

Authenticate is a federation service that verifies a user's identity in an identity store before allowing them to log in and use a Directory Manager application. With Authenticate, users are provided single sign-on support across all Directory Manager applications that use the same identity store.

You can use Directory Manager both as a service provider and as an identity provider.

#### As a Service Provider

Authenticate can be extended with third party single sign-on solutions that support the SAML 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers include:

- AD FS
- Microsoft Entra ID SSO
- Okta
- PingOne
- OneLogin

You can also implement multifactor authentication in `Directory Manager using a third-party single sign-on solution or with the options available in Directory Manager.

See the [Directory Manager as a Service Provider](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/authenticate/asserviceprovider/overview.md) topic for additional information.

#### As an Identity Provider

Directory Manager can be implemented as an identity provider in your organization. The administrator can configure third-party applications (service providers) with Directory Manager, in which case Directory Manager authenticates and authorizes users for those applications. See the
[Directory Manager as an Identity Provider](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/authenticate/asidentityprovider/overview.md) topic for additional information.
