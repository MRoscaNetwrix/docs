# Welcome to the SSPR Portal

A Self-Service Password Reset portal (SSPR) is a type of Directory Manager portal that only facilitates password-related functions. It enables users to manage their directory account passwords, i.e., the password for the account they use to access their workstations and other Microsoft services.

Using the portal, users can:

- Enroll their accounts in Directory Manager
- Change their identity store account (directory) password
- Reset their identity store account (directory) password
- Unlock their identity store (directory) accounts
- Link their accounts in different identity stores

See the [Compatibility](/docs/groupid/groupid/gettingstarted.md#compatibility) and [Localization](/docs/groupid/groupid/gettingstarted.md#localization) topics for information on the devices, browsers, and languages that Directory Manager supports.

## Launch the Portal

Use the SSPR portal URL the administrator has provided you to launch the portal. The Welcome to GroupID page lists the following functions:

- Enroll
- Change Password
- Reset Password
- Unlock

You can either click a function and then sign in to perform that function or first sign in and then select a function.

- Click a link to perform the specific function. Since you are not signed in, you will be redirected to the GroupID Authenticate page. See the [Log in](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/login.md#log-in) topic for signing into the portal. Then you can proceed to perform the specific function. See the [Manage your Identity Store Accounts](/docs/groupid/groupid/ssprportal/functions.md) topic for a discussion of these functions.
- To sign in before accessing any function, click the Login link in the top right corner. You will be redirected to the GroupID Authenticate page. See the [Log in](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/login.md#log-in) topic for signing into the portal. On signing in, the main portal page is displayed.
