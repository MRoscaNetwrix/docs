# Schedule a Job / Job Collection

The Directory Manager scheduling function enables you to set any Synchronize job or job collection to run automatically. Create a Synchronize schedule and add Synchronize jobs and job collections as targets. When the schedule runs, the target jobs and job collections
are executed.

To create a Synchronize schedule, see the [Synchronize Schedule](/docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/schedule/synchronize.md) topic.
