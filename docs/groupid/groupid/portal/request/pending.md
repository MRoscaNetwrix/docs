# Request Inbox

Using the Directory Managerportal, designated approvers can view the workflow requests and approve or deny them accordingly. On the left navigation bar, click __Requests__. Then click the __Request Inbox__ to view the workflow requests
that are waiting for approval. You can also view the request count next to the __Request Inbox__ label.

By default, the page displays pending requests that were initiated today. You can also view processed (approved or denied) requests. Use add filters to filter the requests list as required.

For each request, you can view the description, approver(s), requester name, the target to change, status of the request, creation date, and the reason why that request was denied. Expand a request to view more details, such as the field changed along with its old and new value.

You can perform the following functions on __Requests Inbox__ page:

- [Approve a request](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/request/allrequest.md#Approve-a-request).
- [Deny a request](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/request/allrequest.md#Deny-a-request).
- [Filter requests](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/request/allrequest.md#Filter-requests).
