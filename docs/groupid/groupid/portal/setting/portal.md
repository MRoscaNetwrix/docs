# Portal Settings

You can fine-tune your portal pages by customizing display options. This also enables you to personalize the GroupID portal.

These settings are saved for a user with respect to the identity store. When this user logs on to another GroupID portal for the same identity store, the settings apply there too.

## Set Identity Store mode

GroupID portal works with a single identity store. However, GroupID also enables administrators to link different identity stores. If an administrator creates a GroupID Portal and associates it with the linked identity stores, the portal users can
view the data from the linked identity stores at the same time, rather than having to switch identity stores.

Via Portal settings, you can choose either of the two modes by following these steps:

Step 1 – Click the __Settings__ icon at the top of the page.

Step 2 – From the __Identity Store Mode__ list, select one of the following mode:

- Stand-alone mode
- Linked mode

Step 3 – Click __Save__.

## Set a language for notifications

GroupID generates a number of notifications that are, by default, sent to users in the English language. However, a user can opt to receive notifications in a different language by personalizing the language settings from the __User Settings__ panel in the portal.

However, there are a few exceptions to it. See the [Notifications](/docs/groupid/groupid/admincenter/notification/overview.md) topic for more information.

Step 1 – Click the __Settings__ icon at the top of the page.

Step 2 – From the __Notification Language__ list, select a language for receiving the notifications.

Step 3 – Click __Save__.

## Set the time zone

You can set the portal's date and time for your time zone.

Step 1 – Click the __Settings__ icon at the top of the page.

Step 2 – In the __User Time Zone__ list, select the time zone for your region.

Step 3 – Click __Save__.

## Set a default start page

You can set the first page you see when you log into the portal.
