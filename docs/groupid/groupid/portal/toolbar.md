# Toolbar

Use the toolbar to perform different actions on the portal pages. Buttons on the toolbar vary, depending on the page you are on. Toolbar buttons are listed in the following table.

| Button | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![expire](/static/img/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/expire.jpg) | The behavior of this button depends on the expiry policy of the selected group.   - When the group has its expiry policy set to ‘never expire’, clicking this button displays an error message that the group cannot be expired. - When the group has an expiry policy other than ‘never expire’, clicking this button expires the group and moves it to the My Expired Groups page. - A group without an expiry policy will not expire.
