# Create a Microsoft Entra ID User

In Directory Manager portal, you can create mail-enabled and non mail-enabled users.

NOTE: In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, users can only be created as non mail-enabled. Create a mailbox as an alternative to a mail-enabled user.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create User wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a user in Microsoft Entra ID

Step 1 – In the Directory Manager portal, click the __Create New__ button in the left pane and select __User__.

The Create User wizard opens to the Account page.

Step 2 – On the Account page, specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and the UPN suffix. See the [Account page ](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/azure/account.md)topic for additional information.

Step 3 – On the Password page, provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific options. See the [Password page ](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/azure/password.md)topic for additional information.

Step 4 – Use the Directory Roles page to assign a role and role privileges to the user on the Microsoft Entra Admin Center portal. See the [Directory Roles page](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/azure/directoryrole.md) for additional information.

Step 5 – On the Summary page, review the settings and then click __Finish__ to complete the wizard.

NOTE: If the Directory Manager administrator has specified the user creation action for review, your changes will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the [Requests](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/request/overview.md) topic for additional information.
