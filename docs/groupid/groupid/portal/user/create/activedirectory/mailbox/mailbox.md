# Create an AD Mailbox

You can create a mailbox using Directory Manager portal when a messaging provider has been configured for the identity store.

A mailbox is a user with a mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create Mailbox wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a mailbox in Active Directory

Step 1 –  In the Directory Manager portal, click the __Create New__ button in the left pane and select  __Mailbox__.

The Create Mailbox wizard opens to the Account page.

Step 2 – On the [Account page](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/account.md), specify basic account info, such as the object's first name, last name, login ID and the UPN suffix.

Step 3 – On the [Password page](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/password.md), provide a password for the mailbox account and set other password-specific options.

Step 4 – On the [Exchange page](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/mailbox/exchange.md), set the alias and Office 365 subscriptions.

Step 5 – On the [Summary Page](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/summary.md), review the settings and then click __Finish__ to complete the wizard.

NOTE: If the Directory Manager administrator has specified the mailbox creation action for review, your changes will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the [Requests](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/request/overview.md) topic for additional information.
