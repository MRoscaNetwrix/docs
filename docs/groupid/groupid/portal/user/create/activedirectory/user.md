# Create an AD User

In Directory Manager portal, you can create mail-enabled and non mail-enabled users.

NOTE: In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, users can only be created as non mail-enabled. Create a mailbox as an alternative to a mail-enabled user.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create User wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a mail-enabled user in Active Directory

Step 1 – In the Directory Manager portal, click the __Create New__ button in the left pane and select __User__.

The Create User wizard opens to the Account page.

Step 2 – On the [Account page](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/account.md), specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and the UPN suffix.

Step 3 – On the [Password page](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/password.md), provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific options.

Step 4 – Use the [Exchange page](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/messaging.md), to create the user as mail-enabled.

Step 5 – On the [Summary Page](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/summary.md), review the settings and then click Finish to complete the wizard.

NOTE: If the Directory Manager administrator has specified the user creation action for review, your changes will not take effect until verified by an approver. See the [Requests](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/request/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Step 4 – On the [Exchange page](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/messaging.md), clear the __Mail-Enabled__ check box to create the user as non mail-enabled. This disables
the remaining fields on the page.

A non mail-enabled user does not have an email address.

Step 5 – On the [Summary Page](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/user/create/activedirectory/summary.md), review the settings and then click Finish to complete the wizard.
