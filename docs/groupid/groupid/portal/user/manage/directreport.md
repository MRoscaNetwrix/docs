# Update your Direct Reports

To view the users and contacts that report directly to you, click __Users__ on the left navigation bar and select __My Direct Reports__.

The page lists the direct reports for which you are the primary manager. To include the direct reports for which you are an additional manager, select the __Display Additional Manager Direct Reports__ check box on the User Settings panel.

__You can:__

- View and modify the Properties of a direct report.

  The properties for a direct report are the same as the properties of a user/contact. Refer to the information for user or contact properties to manage the properties of a direct report.
- Select a direct report and click __Delete__ on the toolbar to delete the direct report from the directory.
- Select a direct report and __Managed By__ on the toolbar to get a list of all groups managed by a direct report (i.e., all groups for which the direct report is a primary or additional
  owner).
- Select a direct report and click __Add to Contacts__ on the toolbar. The portal creates the direct report's vCard and prompts you to save it on your machine. You can then use it to add the direct report's email address to
  your email contact list.
- Select a direct report and click __Add to Group__ on the toolbar to the direct report to the membership of a group. The [Find Dialog Box](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/search/find.md) is displayed, where you can search and select
  the group(s) to add the direct report as a member.
- Select a direct report and click __Send email__ on the toolbar to send an email to the direct report. This launches the default Windows email application for sending an email to the direct report.
- Click __Export Results__ on the toolbar to export the direct report list to a Microsoft Excel file.

Use the page numbers under the direct report listing to page through the records.

You can control the number of records to be displayed per page by modifying the __Search results per page__ setting on the User Settings panel. You can modify the search results in Modify Search Directory. You can select entire directory or a domain to search active groups from.

NOTE: You cannot add or remove direct reports on this page. Use the Organization tab of your profile to add or remove your direct reports.  
You can also transfer and terminate your direct reports while you
validate your Profile.

To view any changes made to your direct reports, see the [My Direct Reports' History](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/history/mydirectreport.md) topic for additional information.
