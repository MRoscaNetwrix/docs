# User Properties

You can view and manipulate the properties of directory objects (users, mailboxes, and contacts) in the connected identity store, depending on the permissions the GroupID administrator has granted you.

__You can:__

- Select the required object and click __Properties__ on the toolbar. The object's properties page is displayed.
- Click __Save__ after making any changes in any properties' tab
- Click __Delete__ to delete that user, contact, or mailbox.
- Click __Add to Contacts__ on the toolbar. The portal creates the direct report's vCard and prompts you to save it on your machine. You can then use it to add the direct report's email address to your email contact list.
- Click __Send email__ on the toolbar. This launches the default Windows email application for sending an email to the direct report.
- Click Reset Password to reset the password for the object.
- Click __Organizational Hierarchy__ to view the hierarchy of the object.
