# Manage Group Access

A group's security type determines how non-members can access the group and become its members. Directory Manager provides three security types:

- Private
- Semi-Private
- Public

A security type is assigned to the group when it is created. However, you can change it later, if required.

## Changing the security type for a group

1. In Directory Manager Portal, select __Groups__> [required group node].
2. In the groups list, click the required group and select __Set Security Type__ from the above pane. Select any of the following:

   - Private
   - Semi-Private
   - Public
3. Click __Save__.

## Changing the security type for multiple groups

1. In Directory Manager Portal, select __Groups > [required group node]__.
2. In the groups list, select the required groups and select __Set Security Type__ from the above pane. Select any of the following:

   - Private
   - Semi-Private
   - Public
3. Click __Save__.
