# Query Designer - Storage tab

Settings on the Storage tab are available when the ‘Messaging System Recipients’ option is selected in the __Find__ list.

For the ‘Messaging System Recipients’ option, the default settings on the Storage tab retrieve all mailboxes, irrespective of any server or mailbox store. You can apply a filter to mailboxes you want the query to return.

If filters are specified, the query will return only mailboxes on the specified server or mailbox store. This filter does not affect custom recipients, public folders, and distribution lists.

__Mailbox on this Server__

Returns mailboxes from the server you select from the drop-down list.

__Mailbox on this MailStore__
