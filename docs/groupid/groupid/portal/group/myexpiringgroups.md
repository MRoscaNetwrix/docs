# My Expiring Groups

To view a list of your expiring groups, click __Groups__ on the left navigation pane and select __My Groups__. On the My Groups page, click the __My Expiring Groups__ tab.

Groups that will expire in 30 days or less are considered as expiring groups. The expiry date is calculated from a groupâ€™s expiry policy. The Group Life Cycle job is responsible for expiring these groups on their respective expiry dates; however, you can also manually expire a group before it reaches the expiry date.

By default, the tab lists the groups that you are the primary owner for. To include the groups for which you are an additional owner, select the __Display additional group ownership in My Expiring Groups__ check box on the [Portal Settings](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/setting/portal.md) panel.

You can [Modify Search Directory](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/group/allgroups.md#Modify-Search-Directory) to search expiring groups and add [Filter All Groups](/docs/product_docs/groupid/groupid/portal/group/allgroups.md#Filter-All-Groups)by clicking __My Expiring Group Grid Filters__.
All the expiring groups matching the filters will be displayed.
