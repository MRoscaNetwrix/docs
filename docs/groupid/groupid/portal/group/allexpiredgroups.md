# Expired Groups

This page lists expired groups. A group expires when:

- Its validity period, as defined in its expiration policy, ends.

  OR
- The administrator manually designates a group as expired.

Expired groups are locked for all activities until renewed.

You can [Modify Search Directory](allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search expired groups and add [Filter All Groups](allgroups.md#filter-all-groups) by clicking __Expired Group Grid Filters__.
All the expired groups matching the filters will be displayed.
