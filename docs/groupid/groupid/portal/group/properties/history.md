# Object properties - History tab

This tab displays the object's history, which includes all changes to the object since its creation.

History is available if the administrator has enabled history tracking for the identity store. See [History](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/history/overview.md).

## View History

The __History__ area displays the history for the object. History items in the view are arranged according to date, showing the most recent at the top.

This view is also called the detailed view.

### Switch to Administrative View

Click the __Switch to Administrative View__ link to switch to the administrative view. This view is only available if you have administrative privileges.

It displays history data in a tabular form. History items are grouped by date. Each date group displays changes made to the object during that period.

You can expand an item to view more details, such as the names of the attributes modified in an action along with their old and new values.

## Export History Data

You can export history data displayed on this page to an external file.

1. Click the __Export History__ button and select the file type to export history data to. Supported formats are:

   - Excel
   - CSV
   - XML
2. The file is created at the download location specified in the browser settings.

## Add notes to history items

Directory Manager enables a user to add notes to history items that were logged as a result of any change they made. A note may explain the reason for making a certain change, such as why they changed the security type for a group.

Only the user who added the note can update it. Other users can only view this note; they cannot edit or add comments.

- The Add Note button is available next to a history item listed.
- Once you add a note, the Add Note button changes to View Note. All portal users can use this button to view the note.
