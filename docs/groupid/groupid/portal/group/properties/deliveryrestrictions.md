# Group properties - Delivery Restrictions tab

Use this tab to apply email restrictions to this group. You can manage the list of objects (users, contacts, groups) from whom this group can and cannot receive emails.

By default, no object is added to the __Accept from__ and __Reject from__ lists, which indicates that the group can receive emails from any object. However, when you specify an object in the __Accept from__ list,
the group will receive emails from that object only.

__A scenario can be as:__

If you want the group to receive emails from all except one member (Member A) of a group (Group A), add Group A to the Accept from list and then add Member A to the Reject from list.

__Accept from__

Shows the objects that can send emails to the group.

__Reject from__

Shows the objects whose emails will not be delivered to the group.

__Add__

To add an object to a list, click __Add__ in the respective area. Enter a search string to locate the required object, or click __Advance__ to use the [Find Dialog Box](/docs/groupid/groupid/portal/search/find.md) for
performing a search.

__Remove__

To remove an object from a list, select it and click __Remove__ in the respective area.
