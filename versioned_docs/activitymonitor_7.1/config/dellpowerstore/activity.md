# Dell PowerStore Activity Auditing Configuration

A Dell PowerStore device can be configured to audit Server Message Block (SMB) protocol access events. All audit data can be forwarded to the Dell Common Event Enabler (CEE). The Netwrix Activity Monitor listens for all events coming through the Dell CEE and translates all relevant information into entries in the TSV files or syslog messages.

If the service is turned off, a notification will be sent to the Dell CEE framework to turn off the associated Activity Monitor filter, but the policy will not be removed.

The Dell CEE Framework uses a “push” mechanism so a notification is sent only to the activity agent when a transaction occurs. Daily activity log files are created only if activity is performed. No activity log file is created if there is no activity for the day.
