# Activity Agent Ports

Firewall settings depend on the type of environment being targeted. The following firewall settings are required for communication between the Agent server and the Netwrix Activity Monitor Console:

| Communication Direction | Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The Windows firewall rules need to be configured on the Windows server, which require certain inbound rules be created if the scans are running in applet mode. These scans operate over a default port range, which cannot be specified via an inbound rule. For more information, see the Microsoft [Connecting to WMI on a Remote Computer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa389290(v=vs.85).aspx) article.

There might be a need for additional ports for the target environment.
