# Antivirus Exclusions

Windows activity monitoring and performance of the Activity Agent may be negatively affected by
antivirus protections. Add the following components to antivirus exclusions in order to avoid
potential performance degradation.

## Directories

The following directories can be added to antivirus exclusions:

- `<INSTALL_DIR>` — Agent installation directory. Default path is
  `%ProgramFiles%\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent`. The agent stores binaries and install files in
  this location.
- `<DATA_DIR>` — Agent configuration directory. Default path is
  `%ProgramData%\Netwrix\Activity Monitor\Agent`. The agent stores configuration, and debug log
  files in this location.
- `<DATA_DIR>\ActivityLogs` — Default location for collected activity files. If files are stored in
  a separate location, specify the user-designated directory instead of the default location.
- `<DATA_DIR>\Data` — Various temporary data files, which may be actively updated.

## Binary Files

The following binary files can be added to antivirus exclusions:
