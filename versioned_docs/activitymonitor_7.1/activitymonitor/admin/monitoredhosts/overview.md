# Monitored Hosts Tab

Understanding Monitored Hosts

There are many types of hosts or platforms that can be monitored using the Activity Agent or Linux
Agent:

- Windows
- Dell Celerra or VNX
- Dell Isilon/PowerScale
- Dell PowerStore
- Dell Unity
- Hitachi
- Linux – Configuration of a Linux host is done during agent deployment. See the
  [Linux Agent Deployment](/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/activitymonitor/admin/agents/add/linux.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Nasuni
- NetApp
- Nutanix
- Panzura
- Qumulo
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- SharePoint
- SharePoint Online
- Exchange Online
- SQL Server

See the
[Add New Host Window](/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/activitymonitor/admin/monitoredhosts/add/overview.md)
topic for additional information.

Agents

An agent must be deployed to the server to be monitored for:

- Linux
- SharePoint
- Windows

For all other hosts, the agent is deployed to a Windows proxy server.

Tab

Once the agent(s) installation is complete, hosts can be added for monitoring. The tab is not
visible within the console until at least one agent has been deployed.

This tab is comprised of a button bar and a table of hosts being monitored. A list of outputs is
listed under each monitored host. These are destinations to which events are forwarded.

## Button Bar

The button bar allows users to take the following actions:

![Activity Monitor with Monitored Hosts tab identified](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/activitymonitor/admin/monitoredhosts/monitoredhoststab.webp)

- Toggle Collapse – Expands and collapses all Monitored Hosts for viewing or hiding host's outputs
- Add Host – Opens the Add New Host window to configure monitoring of a new host or platform. See
  the section for instructions on adding the desired target environment.
- Add Output – Opens the Add New Output windows to create new output for the selected host or hosts.
- Remove – Remove the selected hosts or outputs from the monitored hosts table and end monitoring. A
  window prompts for confirmation to remove the selected hosts or outputs.
- Edit – Opens the selected hosts or outputs’ Properties window to modify monitoring settings
- Enable – Resume monitoring which has been stopped or paused
- Disable – Stop or pause monitoring of the selected hosts or outputs

## Bulk Actions

All actions in the button bar except Add Host can be used in the bulk mode. That means youI.e. one
can select several hosts or outputs and edit, disable, enable, remove them, or add new outputs at
the same time.

Bulk editing allows the user to selectively modify hosts or outputs. For example, with bulk editing
it is possible to add a user to Account Exclusions, or set the retention period for log files, or
disable reporting of Directory Read operations, etc.

To initiate bulk editing, select multiple hosts or outputs (`Ctrl+A` and `Ctrl+Shift+A` may help
here), and click the **Edit** Edit button. The Properties window shows divergent settings as blank
or in the unknown state or with the `&lt;-Different-Values-&gt;` marker for the list-like settings.
Leave the `&lt;-Different-Values-&gt;` marker to preserve the difference in each selected object, or
delete it to remove all divergent elements. When the window closes, only changed properties are
saved to all selected objects, leaving unchanged properties untouched.

## Table

The monitored hosts table provides the following information:

- State — State of the monitored host. The two states are Enabled and Disabled.
- Monitored Host – Name or IP Address of the host being monitored
- Report As — How the Monitored Host is being reported as. This can be customized in the host's
  properties.
- Details — Displays additional details about the monitored host, such as the Platform and the Log
  Path.
- Agent – Name or IP Address of the server where the activity agent is deployed
- Retention – Number of days for which the activity log files are retained
- Log Size – Size of the activity log files
- Status – Indicates the status of activity monitoring for the host. See the Error Propagation topic
  for additional information.
- Received Events – Timestamp of the last event received
- Comment – Comment provided by user:
    - Often this indicates the desired output, e.g. Enterprise Auditor.
    - This can be useful if adding the same monitored host multiple times with different
      configurations for different outputs.
    - If a Activity Monitor Agent has been deployed to a Windows server where an activity agent is
      deployed, then the Comment identifies the host as “Managed by Activity Monitor”, and that
      ‘monitored host’ is not editable. Add the host again for other outputs.

Hosts can have more than one output. To view a host's outputs, expand the host by clicking the white
arrow to the left of the Monitored Host name.

For integration with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, only one configuration of a ‘monitored host’ can be
set as the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor output. After a ‘monitored host’ has been added, use the Edit
feature to identify the configuration as being for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor on the Log Files tab
of the host’s Properties window. See the
[Log Files Tab](/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/activitymonitor/admin/outputs/logfiles.md) topic
for additional information.

## Monitoring Status

The Status collapsible section located above the Status Bar of the Activity Monitor provides
visibility into a host's monitoring state and history of state changes. Host monitoring status is
depicted in the Monitored Hosts table under the Status column. Users can expand the Status section
to view more information on various status conditions.

![errorpropogationpopulated](/img/versioned_docs/activitymonitor_7.1/activitymonitor/admin/monitoredhosts/errorpropogationpopulated.webp)

Click the **Down Arrow** to expand the Status section. The information listed is dependent on which
host or output is currently selected in the Monitored Hosts table. Users can find information on the
**Current State** of a host, as well as viewing a history of changes in state.

The possible statuses depend on the type of hosts being monitored. What is common is that the status
can help identify a problem and provide a possible workaround. The following sections provide more
information about device-specific states.

### Linux Monitoring Status

For file activity monitoring on Linux, Activity Monitor relies on **auditd** component of the Linux
Auditing System. One of the features of auditd is the immutable mode, which locks the audit
configuration and protects it from being changed. When the immutable mode is enabled, the only way
to change the auditing configuration is to reboot the server.

Activity Monitor supports the immutable mode. It compares the current auditd configuration with the
desired one. If they differ and the immutable mode is enabled, the product displays a warning in the
status section that a server restart is required. After the reboot, the changes take effect and the
immutable mode is enabled.

### Qumulo Monitoring Status

The **No connections from Qumulo clusters** error may be displayed in the status section. This error
indicates that the Qumulo nodes have not yet connected to the agent. This can happen either because
an incorrect address or port is specified in the Audit page of the Qumulo Web Interface, or because
the port (4496 by default) is blocked by a firewall.
