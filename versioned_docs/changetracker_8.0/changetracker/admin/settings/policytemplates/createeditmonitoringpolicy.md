# Create/Edit a Configuration Monitoring Policy

A __Configuration Monitoring Policy__ template comprises a wide range of attributes that can be monitored including Files/Folders and File Contents, Registry Keys/Values, Installed Software and Updates, Processes and Services (Running and Startup states), Security and Audit Policy\* and Local User Accounts (\* Windows platforms only).

One of the key strengths of Netwrix Change Tracker is that even the configuration of complex FIM policies is straightforward. Templates for all standard platforms are provided, based on trusted guidance from the Center for Internet Security.

- To create a new Configuration Monitoring Template, either upload a pre-defined template file provided by Netwrix or click + Add a Template.

- To edit a template, just click on the __Edit__ button alongside the template name.

When a custom policy is needed, for example, to protect the integrity of a bespoke application, set-up is easy too. Paths and files to track are specified along with details of the file/folder-match specification to use â€“ these can be pre-defined and just picked off from a drop-down menu so there is no need to always be working out commands to use and any regular expressions needed to target the tracking.

Similarly, there is a simple way to define exclusions, again with or without using a file/folder-match specification. This same approach is extended to Registry tracking so that precisely the keys and values that need to be tracked are.

This results in a precision, tailor-made monitoring policy to only track changes where required, eliminating spurious changes and unwanted change noise.
