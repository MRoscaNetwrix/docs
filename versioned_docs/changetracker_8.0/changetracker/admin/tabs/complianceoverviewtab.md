# Overview Tab

The concept of this page is to give an at a glance view of the trend in compliance with your adopted hardened build standard – is it being maintained or improved or in decline?

Device compliance is displayed in the __Compliance Report__ – all devices assigned the report selected will be displayed.

- Device/Time Filters – Content is controlled by your Device/Group/Time filters.
- __Dashboardlets per policy/grouping__ – For each group and report, an additional Dashboardlet will be displayed, allowing you to run a variety of compliance reports against the same Group of systems, for example, PCI and NIST 800-53.
- __Risk by Group__ – A Risk score can be assigned via the __Settings__ -> __Groups__ page, this provides an added dimension to prioritize focus on groups. See the [Device Groups](/versioned_docs/changetracker_8.0/changetracker/admin/settings/devicegroups.md) topic for additional information.
