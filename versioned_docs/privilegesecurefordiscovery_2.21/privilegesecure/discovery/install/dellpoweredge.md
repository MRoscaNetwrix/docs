Systems with an integrated Dell Remote Access Control (iDRAC) have a default user name and password, but you can also configure them with a __secure password.__

### Default iDRAC login

In the iDRAC's default configuration, the login credentials are as follows:

> - Username: root
> - Password: calvin

### Secure Password

For __iDRAC9__, a new feature called __secure password__ is available during the purchase configuration.

- If you have opted for secure default access to iDRAC, __the iDRAC secure password is available on the back of the system information tag (Service Tag) under "iDRAC Default Password__."
- If you have not opted for secure default access to iDRAC, then the default password should be blank. In this case, the default username and password (root/calvin) apply.
