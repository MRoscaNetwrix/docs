## General Log Format

Most log lines are output in JSON format. The exact structure varies by service. See Service-Specific Log Format section below. See the [Splunk (JSON) Source Type](/versioned_docs/privilegesecurefordiscovery_2.21/privilegesecure/discovery/integrations/siem/splunkjson.md) topic for additional information.

### Event Logs vs Debugging Logs

- Debugging logs – logs with a ```"debugging": true``` flag are meant for troubleshooting and are subject to change without notice.

Example

```
{  
"asctime": "2020-09-23 16:19:19,622",  
"debugging": true,  
"jobId": "46b0f845-5a35-4433-b955-195a8a794985",  
...  
}  

```

- Event logs – all other logs without the ```"debugging"``` flag should _not_ be changed without notice (via an entry in the changelog).

__NOTE:__ Dynamic data (such as timing, system name, etc...) are not considered changes

### Log Levels

__NOTE:__ Older log messages may not follow this format, but are being migrated over.

- Critical – Service is going down (people should be woken up)
- Error – Definitely a problem (should be reported to someone, tests should fail)
- Warning – Something concerning, but may not actually be a problem

  - Example – Most network-related issues are only a problem if they happen frequently
- Info – Normal event/ info log
- Debug – More information than is normally needed, usually only used when troubleshooting
