# Application Log CheatSheet Basics

This document will review the basics of the local logging for Privilege Secure application.

## Services Locally Logged

By default Privilege Secure logs locally the below services

- Expire
- LDAP
- Scanner
- Worker

__NOTE:__ The API service (which shows all web/UI actions and events) is by default not logged locally, but can be configured to do so. This requires a restart of the Fluentd service which No downtime is expected. The Fluentd service is the log parser for all other services and as a proactive measure we advise to have an internal change request window in place before making this change.

## Local Logging naming convention and details

All local logs start with the naming convention “svc-” for service. The below attributes are configured for Privilege Secure’s service logging.  
Local log rotation is set for each file under the ```/discovery/data/logs``` directory. Once the file size reaches __10MB__ the “active” file will be rotated and renamed to an “archived” file ending in a number 1-5. For retention purposes only 5 archived files, plus 1 active file, will be kept locally for each service.

## Local logs location

The location of all Privilege Secure service logs, within the appliance, are under the ```/discovery/data/logs``` directory.

Example:

```
secureone@ip-10-100-11-20:~$ ls /secureone/data/logs/ | grep svc  
svc-expire.log  
svc-expire.log.1  
svc-expire.log.2  
svc-expire.log.3  
svc-expire.log.4  
svc-expire.log.5  
svc-ldap.log  
svc-ldap.log.1  
svc-ldap.log.2  
svc-ldap.log.3  
svc-ldap.log.4  
svc-ldap.log.5  
svc-scan.log  
svc-scan.log.1  
svc-scan.log.2  
svc-scan.log.3  
svc-scan.log.4  
svc-scan.log.5  
svc-worker.log  
svc-worker.log.1  
svc-worker.log.2  
svc-worker.log.3  
svc-worker.log.4  
svc-worker.log.5  

```

## Access and Viewing Log content

To access and view these logs, use the __cat__ or __tail__ command(s) to display the content.

The __cat__ command shows static content for the log referenced. The below example showing the cat command combined with the head and nl commands to show the top 3 lines (__head -3__)  of the file, numbered (__nl__).

```
secureone@ip-10-100-11-20:~$ cat /secureone/data/logs/svc-scan.log | head -3 | nl  
1 {"asctime": "2022-03-17 14:56:33,609", "jobId": "33633247-8109-4f04-82a6-51ab3cda3564", "levelname": "DEBUG", "message": "Getting  
2 {"asctime": "2022-03-17 14:56:33,619", "jobId": "73c4a8a1-967b-4642-8ae9-314092438bdb", "levelname": "DEBUG", "message": "Getting  
3 {"asctime": "2022-03-17 14:56:33,620", "jobId": "33633247-8109-4f04-82a6-51ab3cda3564", "levelname": "DEBUG", "message": "Getting  

```

The tail command, with the -f flag with show the last 10 lines, by default, that are written to the logs as they are being written to the logs, numbered (__nl__).

```
secureone@ip-10-100-11-20:~$ tail /secureone/data/logs/svc-scan.log | nl

## Fluentd(stdout) Log viewing

As mentioned the Fluentd service is the log parser for all services. Because of this, all services (API, Scanner, Worker, Expire, Fluentd, analytics\_engine, ) are accessible via the stdout (standard out) where all the services/processes are written to.

To view all of the service’s events directly from the appliance, in real time, run the below command. This command shows the events within a “real time frame” which has a general 3-5 minute window from the actual action/event occurring. Since this is a “real time” view of events there is no availability to review the logs historically with this method, which is why there is the local logging files mentioned above.

These logs are in JSON format and are color coded. This command/tool is best used for troubleshooting of Fluentd service or API, if API local logging is not configured yet, but has other uses.

```s1 logs```

Example:

```
secureone@ip-10-100-11-40:~$ s1 logs
