# Accounts and Required Permissions

Netwrix Data Classification uses the following accounts:

| Account | Description |
| --- | --- |
| __Service Account__ | This account is specified during the product setup.  Windows domain account that you plan to use as a service account will need the following:   - Local Administrator rights on the server where Netwrix Data Classification will be installed. - Permissions to run the Windows Services and IIS Application pool. - SQL Server DBO permissions to the NDC SQL database (if using Windows Authentication to access SQL Server).   After installation, this account will be automatically granted the __Logon as a service privilege__ on the Netwrix Data Classification server.  __NOTE:__ Optionally, you can use local account instead of domain account. |
| Crawl content | Ensure the availability of accounts with sufficient permissions to access your content sources:   - SharePoint, SharePoint Online site collection— Site Collection Administrator role. - Exchange mailboxes:  1. __ApplicationImpersonation__ —allows the crawling account to impersonate each of the mailboxes / users configured for collection. 2. __Mailbox Search__ —allows the crawling account to enumerate mailboxes, i.e. automatic discovery of mailboxes.   See [Configure Microsoft Exchange for Crawling and Classification](/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/config_infrastructure/configure_exchange.md) for detailed information on configuring these permissions.   - Outlook Mail Archive (PST file)— __Read__ permission. - File System (SMB, NFS) — __Read__ permission for the folders and files you need to crawl. - G Suite and Google Drive —service account needs permissions to read data in the individual and shared Drives on behalf of users using the Google Drive API.   See [Configure G Suite and Google Drive for Crawling](/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/config_infrastructure/configure_gdrive.md) for detailed information.   - Database— __Read__ permission for the database schema and data. |
| Apply tagging | To use tagging, i.e. to write classification attributes back to the content file, service account will need the appropriate __Modify__ permissions on the content source. |
