# Initial Product Configuration

The Product Configuration Wizard allows you quickly configure basic Netwrix Data Classification settings such as processing mode, taxonomies, etc.

In your web browser, navigate to the following URL: http://hostname/conceptQS where hostname is the name or IP address of the computer where Netwrix Data Classification is installed and perform initial configuration steps.

On the Instance step, provide the unique name for your Netwrix Data Classification instance. For example, _"Production"_.
