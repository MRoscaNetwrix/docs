# Data Subject Access Requests

Starting with version 5.5.3, Netwrix Data Classification offers support for Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR) against the indexed content sources. It provides an interface which allows Subject Access Requests to be carried out by specifically appointed team members, without elevated access or inappropriate data exposure. Depending on assigned DSAR role, a user can view his / her searches or searches submitted by other users. SAR administrators can leverage a simple, intuitive interface to ensure reliable results and simplify the process of searching the IT estate for data.

All search requests are run by the scheduled time set by a Super User. If you have one or more pending searches and for some reason want to run them immediately, you can use the Run now option. For more information, see [DSAR Settings](/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/dsar/dsar_settings.md).
