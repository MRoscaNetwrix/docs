# Users and Security Settings

The Users  area helps to create and manage users who will be authorized to carry out various administrative functions. It also provides a central mechanism to manage passwords used by the core services to crawl content, as well as the ability to restrict access to the available APIs.

By default, no user roles are defined, and usage of the administrative functions is unrestricted. You must add at least one user in order to restrict access to the administrative functions.

The following types of authentication mechanisms are supported: Windows, ADFS, Azure AD and Forms.
