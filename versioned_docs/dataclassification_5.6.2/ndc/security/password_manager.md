# Password Manager

Password manager can be used to automatically schedule password changes, for service accounts that are being used to access external systems. This is particularly useful when there are business policies in place to change passwords on a rolling basis.

To amend the passwords for a username record first select Passwords from the main display. Then either click Edit on a particular password row, or, click Add Password to add a new password for the account. It is not possible to have overlapping date ranges for the defined passwords, nor is it possible to remove all passwords from a user record.
