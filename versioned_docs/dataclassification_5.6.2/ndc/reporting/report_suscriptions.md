# Report Subscriptions

Subscriptions for report templates enable you to schedule email delivery of a variety of reports or set of specific search criteria. Subscriptions are helpful if you are a rare guest of Netwrix Data Classification and you only need to get statistics based on individual criteria. For example, an IT manager can easily provide auditors with weekly reports to prove compliance with regulations.

To view existing subscriptions for reports, navigate to the __Report Templates__ page on the left and click __View Subscriptions__ next to an existing template to view and edit subscriptions.
