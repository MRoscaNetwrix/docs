# Reviewing SharePoint Dashboard

The SharePoint dashboard is similar to the main reporting dashboard, with the results filtered to SharePoint types. See Review Dashboards for more information on the reporting dashboard.

To open the SharePoint dashboard:

1. In the main window, click __SharePoint__ tab.
2. Select __Dashboard__ on the left.

Here you can examine:

- __Index size__ diagram that shows index size for various entities (subsites, libraries, etc.)
- __Classification coverage__ diagram that identifies the percentage of content that has had classifications applied, and the percentage that has not.
