# File System

Use the Source configuration screen to set up the crawling and classification operations for content
stored in your file server. Netwrix Data Classification can process individual files or folders.
Select, respectively, **File** or **Folder** at the first screen of the Add content source wizard.

## Add Folder source

Use Folder to add the following content sources:

- Windows folders
- SMB (CIFS) shares
- NFS shares

**IMPORTANT!** To add an NFS share, make sure you have configured it for crawling as described in
[Configure NFS File Share for Crawling](/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/config_infrastructure/config_nfs_fs.md)

By default, configuration window displays basic configuration settings only. To configure advanced
settings, click the "wrench" icon in the bottom left corner.

**NOTE:** To configure advanced settings, your user account will need advanced privileges.

| Date Filter                 | Use this calendar control to instruct the program to only crawl the content that has been modified since the specified date. This can be useful for targeting data that is current - in situations where there is a huge volume of content (assuming that the most recent content has the highest risk).                                                                                                                                   |
| Anonymous Access Allowed    | Select this option to disable security filtering for the content source. If cleared, the indexing processes will collect Windows Access Control Lists (ACLs) for the files, and search results will be filtered based upon the end user's Windows identity.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Duplicate Detection Enabled | Select to exclude duplicates (i.e. documents that contain the same text content) from the index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Re-Index Period             | Specifies how often the source should be checked for changes. Netwrix recommends using default values. Default is **7 days**. **NOTE:** Netwrix Data Classification monitors file shares to detect when a document is added/modified. These will then be queued for reprocessing. The source will still be checked for changes based on the re-index period in case any updates are not received. See Manage Sources for more information. |
| Priority                    | Netwrix recommends using default values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Document Type               | Specify a value that will be used to restrict queries when utilising the search index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Anonymous Access Allowed | Select this option to disable security filtering for the content source. If cleared, the indexing processes will collect Windows Access Control Lists (ACLs) for the files, and search results will be filtered based upon the end user's Windows identity. |
| Upload                   | If selected, the file will be uploaded into the NDC SQL database. This will allow the program to present the file to users even if they do not have access to the original file location.                                                                   |

| Max Collector Retries    | Specify how many retries are attempted before automatically removing items from the index when incremental collection indicates that the file has been deleted. Default is **3** retries.                                                                   |
| Re-Index Period          | Specifies how often the source should be checked for changes. Netwrix recommends using default values. Default is **7 days**.                                                                                                                               |
| Priority                 | Netwrix recommends using default values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Document Type            | Specify a value that will be used to restrict queries when utilising the search index.                                                                                                                                                                      |
