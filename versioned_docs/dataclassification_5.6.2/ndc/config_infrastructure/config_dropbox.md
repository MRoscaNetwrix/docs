# Configure Dropbox for Crawling

Netwrix Data Classification connects to and crawls a Dropbox source via a custom Dropbox app,
created within Dropbox management console.

You will need to create a Dropbox App and authorize it. Do the following:

1. Create a new App
2. Generate Access token

To create a new app

To create a new app, you should sign in to Dropbox cloud using a Dropbox Business account with
administrative rights. Refer to
[Dropbox documentation](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/#dropbox-documentation) for
more information on the accounts and rights.

1. Navigate to
   [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create)
2. On the Choose an API step, select Scoped Access.
3. On the Choose the type of access you need step, select Full Dropbox type.
4. Provide a name for your App. For example, Netwrix Data Classification.

    **NOTE:** Remember to agree with Dropbox API Terms and Conditions.

5. Click Create app.

To authorize your app

1. Once your App has been created, navigate to the Permissions tab.
2. Select the following permissions and click submit.

    - account_info.read
    - files.metadata.write
    - files.metadata.read
    - files.content.write
    - files.content.read
    - sharing.read
    - team_info.read
    - team_data.member
    - team_data.team_space
    - files.team_metadata.write
    - members.read

3. Navigate to the Settings tab then scroll down to OAuth2 option and set the members.read Access
   token expiration to _‘No expiration’_ then click Generate under Generated access token.

    **NOTE:** If you change the app’s permissions you will need to regenerate this token.

4. Copy the token to a clipboard. You will need it later when adding a Dropbox source in Netwrix
   Data Classificationadministrative web console.
