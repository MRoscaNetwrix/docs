# Index Maintenance

__NOTE:__ Only available for ‘Superusers’.

You may need to reprocess content or even clean the environment on a large scale —for example, after a large amount of content has been deleted, or after configuring a DQS environment. In such scenarios, index should also be maintained — to ensure data consistency. To automate maintenance operations, you can use a built-in tool named Cleaner.

To launch the Cleaner tool

1. Open NDC Management Web Console.
2. Navigate to __Settings__→ __Config__ and click __Run Cleaner__.
3. Then follow the steps of __Index Maintenance__ wizard.
