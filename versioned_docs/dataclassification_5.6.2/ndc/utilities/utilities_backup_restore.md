# Configuration Backup

**NOTE:** Only available for ‘Superusers’

The Backup utility allows for the migration of complex Netwrix Data Classification instance
configurations.

This allows a user to safely design and test a conceptSearching configuration within a development
environment and then copy the configuration, or specific parts of the configuration, to a different
environment (I.E production).

The tool supports text replacement to allow user defined URL's to be replaced by the equivalent
destination URL. The following configuration options are available for import / export:

- Source Registrations
- SharePoint Termset Registrations
- Workflow Configurations
- Core Configuration Options:

    - Files Excluded
