# Virtual Deployment

In addition to traditional on-premises deployment, Netwrix Data Classification now offers new deployment options that can speed time-to-value by getting you up and running in less than 15 minutes.

Virtual applianceâ€”If you run a Microsoft Hyper-V or VMware vSphere, you can deploy Netwrix Data Classification as a virtual appliance. Virtual appliance is a VM image file with installed Netwrix Data Classification. The image is also configured to use Microsoft Edge as a default web browser.

The following configuration options available:

- Generalized Windows Server 2022, 180-day evaluation version.
- Generalized Windows Server 2019, 180-day evaluation version.
- Generalized Windows Server 2016, 180-day evaluation version.

__NOTE:__ Consider Microsoft limits for evaluation versions of Windows Server. You have 10 days to complete online activation, otherwise your Windows evaluation license expires and the virtual appliance will shut down every hour. Provide a valid license for Windows Server or ensure Internet connection to connect to Microsoft Licensing Activation Center and register your license. Refer to Microsoft article for more information: [Upgrade and conversion options for Windows Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/supported-upgrade-paths).

Furthermore, you can register your license by phone. See [Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers worldwide telephone numbers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers) for more information.
