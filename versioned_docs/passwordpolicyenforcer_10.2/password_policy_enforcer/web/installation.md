# Installation

Password Policy Enforcer/Web V7.11 is designed to run on Windows 2003, 2008, and 2012. Users access
Password Policy Enforcer/Web from their web browser.

### System Requirements

- Windows 2003, 2003 R2, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, or 2012 R2.
- 5 megabytes of free disk space.
- 5 megabytes free RAM.

**NOTE:** Password Policy Enforcer/Web can share server resources with other applications. It can be
installed on an existing, well secured web server.

## Preparing IIS

Windows 2008 and 2012 include a modular version of IIS that only has a small set of core features
enabled by default. Password Policy Enforcer/Web is an ISAPI (Internet Server Application
Programming Interface) extension, so you must enable ISAPI extensions on the server that will host
Password Policy Enforcer/Web.
