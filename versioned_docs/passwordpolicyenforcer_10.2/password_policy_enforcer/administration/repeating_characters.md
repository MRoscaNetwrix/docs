# Repeating Characters Rule

The Repeating Characters rule rejects passwords that contain excessive character repetition.
Reducing character repetition can increase resistance to both brute-force and dictionary cracking
algorithms. The Repeating Characters rule is not case sensitive, so "mypaSssSword" contains four
consecutive repeating characters (SssS).
