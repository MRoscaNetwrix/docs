# Manual Installation (Express Setup)

Manual installation is recommended for small to medium networks. You need to repeat the installation procedure below on every computer that should enforce the password policy. To install Password Policy Enforcer onto a computer:

__Step 1 –__ Start the Password Policy Enforcer installer (PPE10.2.exe).

__Step 2 –__ Read the license agreement, and then click __Yes__ if you accept all the license terms and conditions.

__Step 3 –__ Select the Express option, and then click __Next__.

__Step 4 –__ Select the __Password Policy Server__ check box if it is not selected.

__Step 5 –__ Click __Next__ to install Password Policy Enforcer.

__Step 6 –__ Click __Yes__ when asked to restart the computer.

Password Policy Enforcer has its own password rules, so you may want to disable the Windows password policy rules before configuring Password Policy Enforcer. See the [Disable Windows Rules](/versioned_docs/passwordpolicyenforcer_10.2/password_policy_enforcer/administration/disable_windows_rules.md) topic for additional information.
