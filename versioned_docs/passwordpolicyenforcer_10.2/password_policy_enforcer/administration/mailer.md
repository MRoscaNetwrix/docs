# Mailer

Netwrix Password Policy Enforcer can send email reminders to domain users before their passwords
expire. This is especially useful for users who logon infrequently, and for remote users who access
the network without logging on to the domain. You must install the Password Policy Enforcer Mailer
and configure the email delivery and email message options to send email reminders to users.

Add your email address to a service account, and the Password Policy Enforcer Mailer will remind you
to change the service account password before it expires.
