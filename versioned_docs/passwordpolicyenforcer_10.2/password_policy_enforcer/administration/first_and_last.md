Select the __Enabled__ check box to enable the First or Last Character rule.

Select the __begin__ (First Character rule) or __end__ (Last Character rule) option if you want to specify the __acceptable__ character sets.

Select the __not begin__ (First Character rule) or __not end__ (Last Character rule) option if you want to specify the __unacceptable__ character.

Choose one or more character sets by selecting the check boxes beside the character set names.

__NOTE:__ Click the Messages tab to customize the Password Policy Client rule inserts. The First and Last Character rules use custom character set definitions from the Character rules, even if the Character rules are disabled.
