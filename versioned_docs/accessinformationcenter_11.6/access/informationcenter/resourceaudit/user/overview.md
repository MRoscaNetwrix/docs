# User Reports

User reports are accessed through the User Audit interface. You can access User reports by searching
for user objects on the Home page. See the
[Search Features](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/navigate/search.md)
topic for additional information. The user object being reviewed is identified in the upper-left
corner. The data within these reports is collected by the Enterprise Auditor solutions which provide
data to the Resource reports. See the desired solution topic of the
[Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/enterpriseauditor)
for additional information.

User reports identify the following information as scanned from the targeted environments:

- Everywhere a particular user has access
- What is that user doing with the access
- What Active Directory or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) permissions are applied to the
  user object

Activity reports display information for a selected date range. Some of the reports also include
trend graphs. Trend graphs provide a visual representation of the activity that occurred over the
selected date range. See the
[Activity Report Results Pane Features](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/navigate/overview.md#activity-report-results-pane-features)
topic for instructions on selecting a date range and filtering the trend graphs. Activity reports
display local time stamps. Activity information is represented in two ways:

- Activity Statistics – Statistics reports show the count of operation events performed for the
  selected resource within the selected date range. These events are normalized into the operations
  of Reads, Writes, Deletes, and Manages.
- Activity Details – Details reports show the specific operation events that occurred for the
  selected resource within the selected date range
