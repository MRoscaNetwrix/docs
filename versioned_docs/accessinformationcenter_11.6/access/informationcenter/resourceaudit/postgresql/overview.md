# PostgreSQL Reports

PostgreSQL reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the PostgreSQL resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data within these reports is collected by the Enterprise Auditor PostgreSQL solution. See the PostgreSQL Solution topic in the [Netwrix Enterprise AuditorÂ Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/enterpriseauditor) for additional information.

A single PostgreSQL Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its own node in the Access Information Center. PostgreSQL reports fall into the following categories:

- Permissions reports
- Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the __PostgreSQL__ node:

- [Sensitive Content Summary Report](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/postgresql/sensitivecontentsummary.md)
