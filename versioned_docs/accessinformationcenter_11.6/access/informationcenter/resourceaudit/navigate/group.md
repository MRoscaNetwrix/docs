# Group Audit Interface

The Group Audit interface is opened by searching for a particular Active Directory or Entra ID
group. See the
[Search Features](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/navigate/search.md)
topic for additional information. It contains three panes in all audit interfaces: Reports, Results,
and Group Membership.

breadcrumb. See the
[Group Reports](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/group/overview.md)
topic for additional information.
