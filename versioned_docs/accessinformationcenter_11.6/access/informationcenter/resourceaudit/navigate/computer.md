# Computer Audit Interface

The Computer Audit interface is opened by searching for a particular computer. See the [Search Features](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/navigate/search.md) topic for additional information. It contains three panes in all audit interfaces: Reports, Results, and Group Membership.

The computer being audited is identified at the top of the interface as part of the interface breadcrumb. See the [Computer Reports](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceaudit/computer/overview.md) topic for additional information.
