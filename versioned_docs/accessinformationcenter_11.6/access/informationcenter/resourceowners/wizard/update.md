It contains four pages:

-   1. Select Owners — Lists the current owner(s). Modify by adding new owners, removing owners, or
       changing owner priority order (primary, secondary, etc.)
-   2. Description — Enter or modify a note describing the resource
-   3. Access Groups — Enable or disable Access Requests and Owner Ad Hoc changes for this resource.
       When File System or SharePoint resources will be managed through the AIC, it is necessary to
       configure access groups for those resources in the target environment. An access group
       provides one of the following access levels to a specific resource: Read, Modify, or Full
       Control.

    **NOTE:** This feature requires the Access Information Center is to be configured to commit
    changes in Active Directory. Additionally, resource based groups must be set up on the resource.
    See the
    [Commit Active Directory Changes](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/admin/additionalconfig/commitchanges.md) topic
    for additional information.

**Step 2 –** The Select Owners page lists the currently assigned owner(s). Modify as desired and

- Add new owners — Click **Add** to browse for a new owner. See the
  [Add Owner Window](/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceowners/window/addowner.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Remove an owner — Select an owner and click **Remove**
- Change owner priority — Select an owner and use the arrow buttons to change the order

_Remember,_ the first owner in the list is the primary owner. The table has several columns with
information on the owners:

- Owner Name — Name of the assigned owner
- Owner Account — sAMAccountName associated with the owner, as read from Active Directory
- Owner Title — Trustee's title as read from Active Directory
- Owner Mail — Trustee's email address as read from Active Directory
- Owner Department — Trustee's department as read from Active Directory
- Confirmed — Indicates whether or not the assigned owner has confirmed ownership of that resource.
  Tool-tips display when hovering over the icons indicating whether the resource ownership has been
  confirmed, declined, pending response, or that a confirmation has not been requested.

**Step 3 –** The Description page displays any description that has been provided by either the
Ownership Administrator or the assigned owner(s) for the resource. Modify as desired by typing in
the textbox. Then click **Next** to continue.

**Step 4 –** The Access Groups page indicates whether or not the resource is available for Access
Requests or Owner Ad Hoc changes. Modify as desired and click **Next** to continue.

- Allow access requests — Enable/Disable your domain users to make self-service access requests for
  this resource
- Allow owners to change access — Enable/Disable the owner to make ad hoc access changes for this
  resource

**NOTE:** File System and SharePoint resources must have resource based groups configured for each
level of access: Read, Modify, and Full Control. If either option is selected for this resource, it
is necessary to set a group for at least one access level. Select the desired access level and click
**Change**. The Select Group Window opens. Select the desired group and click **OK**. The Select
Group window closes and the group appears in the table. Repeat this step for each access level
desired. See the

topic for additional information.
