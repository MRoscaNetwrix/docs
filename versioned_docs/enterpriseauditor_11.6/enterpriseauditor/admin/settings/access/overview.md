The first type of access that can be granted is Role Based Access for a user or group accessing the Enterprise Auditor Console. The second type of access grants access to an application accessing data remotely through the Web Service using the REST API. See these sections for additional information:

- [Role Based Access](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/access/rolebased/overview.md)
- [Web Service REST API for Applications Accessing Data Remotely](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/access/restapi/overview.md)

The Enterprise Auditor vault provides enhanced security through enhanced encryption to various credentials stored by the Enterprise Auditor application. See the [Application](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/application/overview.md) topic for additional information.

The __Cancel__ and __Save__ buttons are in the lower-right corner of the Roles view. These buttons are enabled when modifications are made to the Roles global setting.

Whenever changes are made at the global level, click __Save__ and then __OK__ to confirm the changes. Otherwise, click __Cancel__ if no changes were intended.
