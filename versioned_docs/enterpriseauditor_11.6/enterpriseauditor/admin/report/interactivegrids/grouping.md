# Grouping Data

If grouping is enabled, the __Group by__ field provides a drop-down list of categories by which the data can be grouped.

__NOTE:__ Grouping and filtering cannot be enabled at the same time. If grouping is enabled, the Filter icon is disabled in the report.

The following example shows an interactive grid in which grouping has been enabled. See the [Grid](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/wizard/widgets.md#grid) topic for additional information.

The drop-down list to the right of the Group by field can be accessed by clicking the down arrow. Click an item from the drop-down list to group the report by that category.
