The job or job group and all of the selected published reports have been deleted. If you chose not to delete any of the published reports contained in any of the deleted jobs, then those remaining reports can still be viewed in the Web Console, even though the parent has been removed from the Enterprise Auditor Console.

The remaining published reports that weren't deleted are shown in the wizard if you are deleting the parent group of the previously deleted job or group.
