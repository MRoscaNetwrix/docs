Select an option to specify which mailboxes are searched:

- All mailboxes – Search all mailboxes
- Select mailboxes from list – Search only specific selected mailboxes. This option enables the [EWSMailbox: Scope Select](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/datacollector/ewsmailbox/scopeselect.md) page.
