# Cleanup Job Group

The Cleanup job group is designed to report on and take action against resources from targeted file servers that can be cleaned up. Use this job group to assess and remediate stale files according to the data collected by the __0.Collection__ job group. The Cleanup job group runs independently from the rest of the File System solution.

__NOTE:__ The Cleanup job group requires additional licenses to function. For information, contact your Netwrix representative.

The Cleanup job group includes the following job groups and jobs:

- [1. Cleanup Assessment > FS\_CleanupAssessment Job](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/filesystem/cleanup/fs_cleanupassessment.md) – Designed to report on and assess the status of target file servers that can be cleaned up
- [2. Notify Job Group](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/filesystem/cleanup/notify/overview.md) – Designed to report on and notify the owners of resources of target file servers that data is pending cleanup
- [3. Quarantine Job Group](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/filesystem/cleanup/quarantine/overview.md) – This job group offers a framework for using the File System actions modules to quarantine files, and to restore access to quarantined files if necessary
- [4. Delete Job Group](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/filesystem/cleanup/delete/overview.md) – Designed to report on and take action against resources from targeted file servers that can be deleted
- [FS\_CleanupProgress Job](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/filesystem/cleanup/fs_cleanupprogress.md) – Summarizes the progress of the Cleanup effort and highlights the amount of storage reclaimed on each host

Many jobs in this group include one or more pre-built actions designed to apply operations to the data tables generated by the job’s analysis tasks. These actions perform the cleanup operations. By default, the actions do not execute as part of the job group. You must select the actions you want to run prior to execution. See the [Action Modules](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/action/overview.md) topic for additional information.
