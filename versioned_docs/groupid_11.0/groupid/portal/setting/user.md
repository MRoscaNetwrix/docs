# User Account Settings

Using the GroupID portal, you can manage your profile information and even change your password, provided that the GroupID administrator has granted you the required permissions. You can also add your picture to your profile.

Administrators can also reset the passwords of other user accounts in the identity store. They can also set the expiration policy of user accounts, lock or unlock accounts, and enable or disable accounts.
