# Reset Passwords

The GroupID portal enables enrolled users in an identity store reset their account passwords securely. They can reset their passwords if they have forgotten or lost their existing passwords. Unenrolled users can reset their passwords if the administrator
has enabled the Second Way Authentication option for their role.

The GroupID portal provides an authentication mechanism, whereby users must authenticate themselves with Multifactor Authentication type(s) they enrolled their accounts with.

If the administrator has enabled multifactor authentication for the identity store, users must authenticate their accounts using the authentication type(s) they enrolled their account with. After successful authentication, users can reset account
password in accordance with the password policies the GroupID administrator has defined for your role in theÂ identity store.
