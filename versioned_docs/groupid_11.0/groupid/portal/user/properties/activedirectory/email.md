# Object properties - Email tab

Use this tab to view the addresses assigned to this object.

__Addresses__

In case of a mail-enabled object, the messaging provider (such as Microsoft Exchange) assigns different addresses to it for communication with different repositories (such as Address Book, SIP, Outlook). These addresses are displayed in this box.

__Subscriptions__

Displays the subscriptions assigned to the mailbox.

It also lists other subscriptions offered by Office 365 to a mailbox user. Select the check box for a subscription to assign it to the mailbox.

The subscription list is displayed for mailbox objects when Office 365 is configured as the messaging provider for the identity store.
