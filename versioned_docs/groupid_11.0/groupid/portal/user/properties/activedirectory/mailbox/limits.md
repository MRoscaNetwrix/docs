# Mailbox properties - Limits tab

This tab applies to mailboxes only. It allows you to set the storage quota for the object's mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

__Use default storage quota__

Select this check box to use the default quota for the mailbox store instead of defining it individually.

__Issue warning (K)__

The mailbox size in kilobytes (KB) for this user, that, when exceeded, triggers an over-limit warning. However, the user can still send and receive messages.

__Prohibit Send (K)__

The maximum mailbox size in kilobytes (KB) for this user, that, when exceeded, suspends the user's ability to send emails.

__Prohibit Send/Receive (K)__

The maximum mailbox size, in kilobytes (KB) for this user, that, when exceeded, suspends the user's ability to both send and receive emails.
