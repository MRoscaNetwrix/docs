# Manage your profile

To view and update your profile information in the directory, click your profile info in the top right corner and select __See full profile__.

The profile page has the same tabs as the user properties page. Refer to the information for [User Properties](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/portal/user/properties/overview.md) to manage your profile.

## User profile validation

If profile validation applies to you, then you must verify and update your profile information in the directory using the GroupID portal.

Profile validation is not a one-time process; rather, the administrator specifies a profile validation life cycle period (for example, 90 days), which implies that you must validate your profile once during each 90-day cycle.

On your profile page, your profile validation status is displayed next to your name.

- The status, __Verified User__, indicates that your profile is validated.
- The status, __Verification Pending__, indicates that you must validate your profile.

  Click __Validate Your Profile__ on the toolbar. The __Validate Profile Properties__ window is displayed, where you can validate your profile.
- The status, __Expired User__, indicates that a user has expired because he or she did not validate his or her profile within the required duration. An expired user is disabled
  in the directory.
