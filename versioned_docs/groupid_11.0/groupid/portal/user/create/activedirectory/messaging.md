# Exchange page

Use this page to create the object as mail-enabled.

1. Make sure that the __Mail-Enabled__ check box is selected to create the user as mail-enabled.

   A mail-enabled user is one with an email address.
2. The __Alias__ box displays an alias for the user.
3. The __Email Type__ displays drop-down list of all the types of email your want to create.
4. In the __Email Address__ box, type an email address for the user. GroupID uses this email address to send email notifications to the user.
5. Click __Next__.

NOTE: To create a mail-enabled user, a messaging provider (such as Microsoft Exchange) must be configured for the identity store.  
 If it is
not configured, the __Messaging__ page is disabled.
