# Password page

Provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific options.

1. Type a password for the user account in the __Password__ and __Confirm password__ boxes.
2. Select the check boxes to set the security options for the user account:
   - __User must change password at next logon__ - to force the user to change the password the next time they log into their workstations with the account.
   - __Account is enabled__ - this check box is selected by default, indicating that the user account is enabled.

     Clear it to disable the account, so that the user would not be able to log-on with it.
3. Click __Next__.
