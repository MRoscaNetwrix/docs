# Create a Microsoft Entra ID Mailbox

You can create a mailbox using GroupID portal when a messaging provider has been configured for the identity store.

A mailbox is a user with a mailbox, such as an Exchange mailbox.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create Mailbox wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.
