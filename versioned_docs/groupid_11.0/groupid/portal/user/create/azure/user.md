# Create a Microsoft Entra ID User

In GroupID portal, you can create mail-enabled and non mail-enabled users.

NOTE: In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, users can only be created as non mail-enabled. Create a mailbox as an alternative to a mail-enabled user.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create User wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.

## Create a user in Microsoft Entra ID

1. In the GroupID portal, click the __Create New__ button in the left pane and select __User__.

   The __Create User__ wizard opens to the Account page.
2. On the __Account__ page, specify basic account info, such as the user's first name, last name, login ID and the UPN suffix.
3. On the __Password__ page, provide a password for the user account and set other password-specific options.
4. Use the __Directory Roles__ page to assign a role and role privileges to the user on the Microsoft Entra Admin Center portal.
