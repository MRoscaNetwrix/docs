# My Requests

To view the workflow requests that you initiated, expand the __Requests__ node on the left navigation bar and select __My Requests__. You can view the requests pending for approval as well as requests that have been processed (approved or denied).

By default, the page displays pending requests that you initiated today. You can also filter the request by adding filters.

For each request, you can view the description, approver(s), requester name, the target to change, status, date the request was made on, and the reason why that request was denied. Expand a request to view more details, such as the field changed along with its old and new value.
