# Find Dialog Box

This dialog box enables you to search __User__, __Group__, and __Contact__ objects in the connected identity store.

The object types available for search may vary, depending on the page you launch the __Find__ dialog box from.

1. From the __Look For__ list, select one or more object types that you want to search for.

   - __Users__ - to search for users only.
   - __Groups__ - to search for groups only.
   - __Contacts__ - to search for contacts only.
2. The __Search In__ list shows all organizational units or containers in the connected identity store. Select the check boxes for the required containers to search in. To search all containers, select the __Entire Directory__ check box.
3. In the __Search__ box, type a search parameter. Below are some tips to get the best out of your searching:

   - You can type the complete string as a search parameter.

     For example, you can type __Administrator__ in this box to find all objects with the display name '_Administrator'_.
   - You can type a part of the string as a search parameter.

     For example, you can type __Ad__ in this box to find all objects with the display name beginning with '_Ad'_.
   - You can use wildcard search if you do not remember the exact search criteria.

     For example, you can type __\*__ in this box to find all objects with any display name or you can type __\*d__ in this box to find all
     objects containing '_d'_ anywhere in their display name.
4. Click the __Advanced Search__ link to display additional search fields (such as description, first name, last name, and company) to search for objects using attributes other than the object's display name.

   NOTE: The fields available for Advanced Search may vary, depending on the portal's configuration.
5. Click the __Search__ button to display the search results.
6. The __Search Results__ section displays a list of objects matching the search criteria.

   From the search results, select the required objects and click the right-arrow to move them to the __Selected Results__ list.
7. The __Selected Results__ section displays the objects that you have selected from the __Search Results__ list.

   Click the left-arrow to move the selected objects from the __Selected Results__ list to the __Search Results__ list.
