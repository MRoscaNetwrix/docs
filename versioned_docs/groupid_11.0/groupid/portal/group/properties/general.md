# Group properties - General tab

This tab allows you to view or modify the general information about the group.

__Display name__

The display name of the group.

__Alias__

The alias for the group.

__Manager can update membership__

Select this check box to enable the group managers (primary owner and Exchange additional owners) to update this groupâ€™s membership directly on the directory server. Additional owners are not included because they are GroupID-specific and the directory
does not recognize them.

This is a provider-end permission and does not impact role-based permissions assigned at the identity store level in GroupID. Nor do role-based permissions assigned at the identity store level have any impact on this feature.

Enabling this setting auto-grants the required permissions to the manager. For Active Directory, for example, the manager is granted the following permissions:

- Create, delete, and manage user accounts.
- Reset user password and force password change at next logon.
- Create, delete and manage groups.
- Modify the membership of a group.

NOTE: Do not update Smart Group membership manually; changes might be reversed when the Smart Group Update job runs.

NOTE: The _manager can update membership_ feature is not available for groups in a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store.

__Description__

The description provided for the group.

__Expiration Policy__

The expiry policy for this group. It specifies the duration the group remains active for. The group would expire when the period ends.

If you select the Other option from the list, two boxes are displayed under the Expiration Policy box. First, select an option (Days, Months, or Years) from the second list. Then enter a value for the selected option in the first box. the group will
remain active for the duration you specify here.

The Group Life Cycle job is responsible for expiring groups.

__Expiration Date__

Displays the expiry date for the group. This box is blank when the expiration policy is set to "Never expire".

When you change the expiration policy of a group, the expiration date is updated when you save the changes.

- __Domain Local__ - Can only contain users in this domain.
- __Global Group__ - Can contain users from other domains but is visible only within its own domain.
- __Universal Group__ - Can contain users and groups from any domain and is visible in the Global Catalog.

NOTE: With Exchange 2013/2016/2019 configured as the messaging provider for the identity store, the group scope must be set to _Universal_ for mail-enabled groups.

NOTE: In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, the group scope does not apply.
