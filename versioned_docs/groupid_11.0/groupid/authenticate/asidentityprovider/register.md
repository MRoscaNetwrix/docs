# Register an Application (Service Provider) in GroupID

To register a service provider in GroupID, you have to create an application for the provider in
GroupID.

Next, while configuring GroupID in the service provider, you have to provide GroupID metadata. You
can copy metadata values and paste them in the service provider.

## Create an Application for a Service Provider in GroupID

1. In GroupID Authenticate, go to the **SAML Applications** tab and click **New Application**.
2. On the **Create Application** page, enter a name for the application in the **Name** box. The
   application will be displayed on the GroupID Login page with this name.
3. Copy the consumer URL from the service provider and enter it In the **Consumer URL** box.
4. Copy the audience URL from the service provider and enter it In the **Entity ID/Audience** box.
5. From the **Identity store** drop-down list, select the identity store to use for authenticating
   users.  
   For single sign-on, third-party application users must authenticate through an identity store
   defined in GroupID. For example, to authenticate users through Active Directory, select an
   AD-based identity store.
6. Next, specify an attribute as a claim. Service provider application users are authenticated in
   GroupID based on this attribute.  
   Enter the attribute name in the **Claims** box. As you type, the system displays the attributes
   in the selected identity store that start with the text. Select the required attribute.  
   GroupID will match the value of this attribute in the application and in the identity store for
   authentication.
7. Click **Browse** under **Identity Provider Image** to upload an image for the application, such
   as the application logo.

    NOTE: Supported image formats: .jpg, .bmp, .webp, and .gif  
     Image file dimensions: 210 x 60 pixels

Specify advanced settings for the application:

8. Expand the **Advanced** section by clicking the down arrow head.
9. Select _Enabled_ or _Disabled_ in the **Response Signing**drop-down list, depending on whether it
   is enabled or disabled in the service provider.
10. Select a response signing method from the **Response Signing Method** drop-down list. This
    method should be the same for the identity provider (GroupID) and the service provider
    (third-party application).
11. Select _Post_ or _Redirect_ in the **Response Binding** drop-down list, depending on how the
    service provider accepts the response.
12. If you are not using assertion encryption, make sure _Disabled_ is selected in the **Assertion
    Encryption** drop-down list.  
    To use assertion encryption as an advanced security feature, select **Enabled**. Then provide
    the certificate, key transport algorithm, and encryption algorithm to encrypt the response.
13. Generate a logout URL in the service provider and enter it in the **Single Logout URL** box.
    When a user clicks this URL, he or she will be logged out of all applications that have been
    authenticated through GroupID (i.e., applications that he or she is single signed in through
    GroupID).
14. Provide the GroupID metadata in the service provider to register GroupID as an identity provider
    in it. See the
    [GroupID Metadata for Service Provider Configurations](#groupid-metadata-for-service-provider-configurations)
    topic.
15. Click **Create Application** to create the service provider in GroupID.

### GroupID Metadata for Service Provider Configurations

As part of registering an application in GroupID, you also have to provide GroupID metadata in the
service provider.

**To copy metadata:**

1. On the **Create Application** page, expand the **Metadata** section by clicking the down arrow
   head.
2. Copy the Issuer URL and GroupID certificate from the **Provider Issuer** and **Provider Signing
   Certificate** boxes and paste them in the service provider.
3. Both the **Provider IDP Redirect Endpoint** and **Provider IDP POST Endpoint** are given here.
   Depending on how the service provider sends the request or the mechanism used, copy the
   appropriate URL and paste it in the service provider.
4. The **Single Logout Endpoint POST** box displays a URL. Requests are posted on this URL for
   logging out from the current and all other third-party applications configured in GroupID.
5. The **Login URL** box displays a URL. On clicking it, the user is redirected to the GroupID Login
   page where GroupID is acting as an identity provider. If the user is already logged into GroupID,
   he/she will be auto-authenticated; else the user will have to provide the credentials.
