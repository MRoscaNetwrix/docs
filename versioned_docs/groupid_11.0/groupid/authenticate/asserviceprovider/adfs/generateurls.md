# Generate URLs

Generate the consumer URL and audience URL for the GroupID client with which you want to configure AD FS. These URLs are required while creating the relying party trust in AD FS.

The consumer URL and audience URL are unique for each GroupID client. Clients include:

- Admin Center
- GroupID portals (each portal is treated as a separate client)
- Management Shell
- GroupID APIs

With multiple instances of GroupID, multiple Admin Centers and Management Shells are available as separate clients.

## Generate the Consumer URL for a GroupID Client

1. In Authenticate, click the __Generate URL's__ tab. The __Generate URL's__ page is displayed.
2. In the __Select Client to Generate Consumer URL__ drop-down list, select a GroupID client to set up AD FS with it. Letâ€™s suppose you select the GroupID portal named _Wizard_.
3. The URL displayed in the __Consumer URL__ box is a unique identifier for the selected client. It is used to set up relying party trust in AD FS. Click __Copy__ to copy it. Then paste it in a file, preferably a text file, to save it.

NOTE: On upgrade to GroupID 11, you must generate the consumer URL again for the GroupID client configured with AD FS, and update it in AD FS.

## Generate Entity ID/Audience URL

1. In Authenticate, click the __SAML Providers__ tab. The __SAML Providers__ page is displayed.
2. Click __New Provider__.
3. On the __Create New Provider__ page, the __Identity stores__ drop-down list displays the identity stores defined in GroupID. Select an identity store.

   The __Client__ drop-down list displays the GroupID clients with respect to the identity store. Select the client with which you want to set up the SAML provider.  
   The client you select must be the one for which you generated the consumer URL.   
   To continue with the example, select the GroupID portal named _Wizard_ in the __Client__ drop-down list.
4. The __Entity ID/Audience__ box displays a URL. Click __Copy__ to copy it. Then paste it in a file, preferably a text file, to save it.
