# Configure in Microsoft Entra ID

In GroupID, you can create an identity store for an identity provider and perform different functions in that provider using its identity store. These functions include group management tasks, such as creating groups, scheduling group updates, and expiring groups; user management tasks, such as creating users and mailboxes, managing usersâ€™ profiles, and more.

GroupID supports multiple identity providers for creating an identity store, including Microsoft Entra ID, formerly Azure Active Directory. This section provides information that will help configure GroupID in Microsoft Entra ID.
