# GroupID APIs

GroupID APIs enable developers to quickly intergrate their applications with GroupID to "perform actions" such as group creation and lifecycle operations using a relevant GroupID API.

Various GroupID functions can be performed using these APIs. The response can be returned in JSON format.

These URLs represent various resources — any information or content accessed at that location, which can be returned in JSON format. Often resources
have one or more methods that can be performed on them over HTTP, like ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, ```PATCH```, and ```DELETE```. The action represented by the first and last of these is clear, but ```POST``` and ```PATCH``` have specific meanings. How they are defined is confusing, but the general rule is: use ```POST``` to create resources, ```PUT``` and ```PATCH``` to update resources.

NOTE: All the APIs documented in the API section are for an Active Directory based identity store. In each API, the __Sample Request Syntax__ and the __Sample Response Syntax__ sections have attributes that are supported in an Active Directory based identity store.
