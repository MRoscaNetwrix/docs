# Reports Schedule

GroupID can generate reports for an identity store on a scheduled basis.

You can create a Reports schedule and add reports to it. When the schedule runs, all added reports are auto generated. The Reports schedule also sends email notifications to the designated recipients.

## Create a Reports Schedule

1. In Admin Center, click __Identity Stores__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Identity Stores__ page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select __Edit__.
3. Click __Schedules__ under __Settings__ in the left pane.
4. On the __Schedules__ page, click __Add Schedule__ and select __Reports Job__. The __Create Schedule__ page is
   displayed.
5. In the __Schedule Name__ box, enter a name for the schedule.
6. The __Name Preview__ box displays the schedule name prefixed with _ReportPortal\__; the schedule is displayed with this name in email notifications.
7. In the __Scheduler Service Name__ drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on the number of Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each cluster has its own Scheduler service. See the [Scheduler Service](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/service/schedulerservice.md) topic.
8. To add reports to the schedule, click __Add Report(s)__ in the __Reports__ area. The __Add Reports to Schedule__ dialog box is displayed.

   NOTE: You can only add reports that have been generated in the GroupID portal, since the schedule uses the settings provided there to generate the report. Moreover, you cannot change the settings here, such as the container and filter settings.

   1. In the __Object Category__ drop-down list, select a report category. Available categories are: _All Categories, Users, Groups, Contacts and Computers_. In the GroupID portal,
      reports are classified under these categories.
   2. The __Reports__ drop-down list shows all reports in the selected category. On selecting a report, one of the following happens:

      - The report is displayed in the grid on the dialog box. This is because it has previously been added, and you do not need to add it again. If the report has been generated multiple times in the GroupID portal, all instances are displayed, since each instance has its own _title_, _container_, and _filter_ settings.
      - If the report is not displayed in the grid, you have to add it using the __Add__ button. (The __Add__ button gets enabled if this report has been generated in the GroupID portal.)

      Notice that when you select a category, a report may get listed in the grid. This is because the first report in the category is auto selected in the __Reports__ drop-down list. If that report has previously been added, it is displayed in the grid.
   3. The report is listed in the grid on the dialog box with the following info:

      - __Report Title__ - the name given to the report by the user while generating it.
      - __Report Name__ - the name of the report in GroupID.
      - __Container__ - the container the report will fetch results from. This container was specified by the user while generating the report.
      - __Filter__ - the criteria applied to get the results.

      You can add as many reports as required.
   4. Select the check box for a report and click __Add__. The selected reports are displayed in the __Reports__ area on the __Create Schedule__ page. When this Reports schedule runs,
      it auto generates all added reports.  
      To remove a report , click __Remove__ for it.
9. Click __Add Triggers__ in the __Triggers__ area to specify a triggering criterion for the schedule, that, when met, starts the execution of the schedule. Follow step 11 in
   the [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/schedule/groupusageservice.md#Create-a-Group-Usage-Service-Schedule) topic to add triggers.
10. Click __Add Authentication__ in the __Authentication__ area to specify an account for running the schedule in the identity store. Follow step 12 in
    the [Create a Group Usage Service Schedule](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/schedule/groupusageservice.md#Create-a-Group-Usage-Service-Schedule) topic for details.
11. To set up notifications for the schedule, click __Notifications__.

    1. On the __Notifications__ dialog box, enter the email address of recipient(s) to whom you want to send the reports generated by the schedule. Use a semicolon to separate multiple addresses.
    2. Click __Save__.
12. On the __Create Schedule__ page, click __Create Schedule__.
13. On the __Schedules__ page, click __Save__.   
    The schedule is displayed under __Reports__. See the [View the Schedules in an Identity StoreÂ ](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/schedule/manage.md#View-the-Schedules-in-an-Identity-Store)topic for details.
