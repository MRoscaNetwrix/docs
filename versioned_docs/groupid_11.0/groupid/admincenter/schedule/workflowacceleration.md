# Workflow Acceleration Schedule

A Workflow Acceleration schedule facilitates the workflow approver acceleration process for workflow requests. This schedule is auto created when approver acceleration is enabled for the identity store. See the [Workflow Approver Acceleration](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/workflow/approveracceleration.md) topic.

By default, the schedule runs daily to accelerate workflow requests to approvers, according to workflow acceleration settings for an identity store and some predefined rules for approver acceleration. It also generates notifications to inform approvers
about pending workflow requests.

You cannot create or delete a Workflow Acceleration schedule; only update the existing one.
