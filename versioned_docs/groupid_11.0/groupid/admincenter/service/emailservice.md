# Email Service

The Email service maintains a queue of all email notification generated by the identity stores in GroupID, and sends them one by one through the SMTP server configured for the respective identity store.

When the SMTP server for an identity store is down, notifications stay in the queue, until they are delivered when the server is up again. Successfully delivered emails are removed from the queue.

For more on the notification queue, see the [Manage the Notification Queue](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/notification/queue.md) topic.

## View Email Service Details

1. In Admin Center, click __Applications__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Applications__ page, click the __Email Service__ tab.  
   The tab displays the default Email service(s) hosted in native IIS. The number of services displayed on the tab depend on the number of Elasticsearch clusters in your environment, as each cluster has its own Email service. See the [Elasticsearch Clusters, Nodes, and GroupID](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/service/overview.md#Elasticsearch-Clusters-Nodes-and-GroupID) topic.  
   For details displayed on a service card, see the table in the [View Data Service Details](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/service/dataservice/manage.md#View-Data-Service-Details) topic.

   You cannot create a new Email service or delete the existing one
