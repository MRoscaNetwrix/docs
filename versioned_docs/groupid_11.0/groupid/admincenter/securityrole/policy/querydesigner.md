# Query Designer Policy

You can define a role-based access policy for the Query Designer. Using the Query Designer, users can create queries for various purposes, as discussed in the [ Specify Smart Group Query Attributes](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/portal/design/queryattributes.md) topic.

The Query Designer policy enables you to restrict the following Query Designer features for a security role:

- Policy application on new groups or on existing groups as well.
- The _Start In_ container - Specify container(s) that will be displayed to role members on the Query Designer. Queries created by role members cannot run beyond the specified containers. You can also enforce the allowed containers so that role members cannot change them.
- Object types - Limit the object types that will be available to role members for including in queries. You can also enforce the allowed object types, so that role members cannot exclude any of them from queries.
- Tabs on the Query Designer - The Query Designer has multiple tabs and all of them are available to users by default. You can choose to hide any of these tab from role members.
- Attributes and their respective operators. - Specify the attributes that will be available to role members for building queries for Smart Groups and Dynasties. For each attribute, you can also specify the operators that role members can apply to it.

![querydesigner](/img/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/securityrole/policy/querydesigner.png)

You can also specify a default filter criterion, involving an attribute, an operator, and a value, that will be displayed to users on the Filter Criteria tab of the Query Designer. Role members can change this criterion as required.

If you already have restricted some schema attributes for the Query Designer pages in portal, those settings will be override by the schema attribute settings specified here.

## Apply the Policy to Groups

You can specify whether the defined role-based access policy for the Query Designer is to be applied on the newly created groups (Smart Groups and dynaasties) in GroupIDÂ  11.1 only or to all existing groups as well.

__To apply the policy on groups:__

1. In Admin Center, click __Identity Stores__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Identity Stores__ page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select __Edit__.
3. Click __Security Roles__ under __Settings__ in the left pane.
4. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Edit__ for a security role.
5. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Specify policies for the members__ in the __Policies__ area.
6. On the __Add Policies__ pane, click the __Query Designer__ tab.
7. On the __Query Designer__ tab:

   - enable the __Apply policy only to newly created groups__ toggle button to apply the policy on the new groups created in GroupID 11.1.

     Let's say the following policy is defined for a user role:

     Start In Container: Users

     Enforce Start In Containers: Enabled

     Objects: Users with Mailboxes

     Users with External Email-Address

     Objects: Users

     Enforce Objects: Enabled

     Default filter Criteria: Department is exactly HR

     When a user of this role creates a new group the policy is applied on it.
   - disable the __Apply policy only to newly created groups__ toggle button to apply the policy on the existing groups as well.

   After some time, if you enable the option again for the user role, the policy (with or without any modification) will no longer be applied to the existing groups. All the Query Designer configurations will be available to the user for the existing groups.

## Limit the Search Scope of the Query to Specific Containers

By default, all containers in the directory and all their sub-containers are displayed in the _Start In_ field on the Query Designer, indicating that the query will run on the entire directory to fetch matching objects. Users can exclude any container or sub-container, though.

You can restrict the search scope of the query to one or more containers and sub-containers for role members. Specify the containers and sub-containers to be displayed in the __Start In__ field on the __Query Designer__ dialog box. You can also enforce the container(s) so that role members cannot remove a container or sub-container.

__To specify container(s):__

1. In Admin Center, click __Identity Stores__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Identity Stores__ page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select __Edit__.
3. Click __Security Roles__ under __Settings__ in the left pane.
4. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Edit__ for a security role.
5. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Specify policies for the members__ in the __Policies__ area.
6. On the __Add Policies__ pane, click the __Query Designer__ tab.
7. On the __Query Designer__ tab, the __Start In Container__ area lists each container and sub-container in the directory individually, indicating that the entire directory is set as the _Start In_ container.

   - To remove a container or sub-container, click __Remove__ for it.
   - To modify the list of allowed containers, click __Modify Container__. On the __Modify Container__ dialog box, select the required containers and sub-containers, and click __OK__. The selected containers are displayed in the __Start In Container__ area.

   You can allow a sub-container even if you do not allow its parent container. In this case, the query will run in the sub-container but not in the parent container.
8. Use the __Enforce Start In Containers__ toggle button to enforce the start-in containers.

   - When you enforce the allowed containers, they will be displayed as disabled in the __Start In__ field on the Query Designer. Role members will not be able to change this setting.
   - When not enforced, role members can remove any of the allowed containers but they cannot add a container beyond the allowed ones.
9. Click __OK__.
10. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Update Security Role__.
11. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Save__.

## Limit the Objects for Use in a Query

By default, several object types are available to users on the Query Designer for including in queries. Users select an object type from the __Find__ drop-down list and then select its sub-types on the _General_ tab of the Query Designer. The query returns the specified object types to include in group membership. The object types and their sub-types are discussed in the [Query Designer - General tab](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/portal/group/querydesigner/general.md) topic.

You can limit the object types available to role members for use in queries. You can also enforce the object types so that role members cannot exclude an allowed object type from queries.

__To limit object types:__

1. In Admin Center, click __Identity Stores__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Identity Stores__ page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select __Edit__.
3. Click __Security Roles__ under __Settings__ in the left pane.
4. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Edit__ for a security role.
5. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Specify policies for the members__ in the __Policies__ area.
6. On the __Add Policies__ pane, click the __Query Designer__ tab.
7. The __Objects__ area lists the object types with their sub-types. Here is a mapping of the object types displayed here with the options in the __Find__ list on the Query Designer:

   - Exchange = Messaging System Recipients  
     Note that the sub-types displayed under __Exchange__ are the same as displayed on the General tab when you select _Messaging System Recipients_ in the __Find__ drop-down list.
   - Computer = Computers
   - All = Users, Contacts and Groups

   Select the check boxes for the object sub-types that you want to display to role members in the Query Designer.
8. Use the __Enforce Objects__ toggle button to enforce the allowed objects.

   - When you enforce the allowed object types, they will be displayed as disabled in the Query Designer. Role members will not be able to exclude any object type; hence all the allowed object types will be included in the query.
   - When not enforced, role members can exclude any of the allowed object types but there is no option to include an object type beyond the allowed ones.
9. Click __OK__.
10. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Update Security Role__.
11. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Save__.

## Hide the Tabs on the Query Designer

The Query Designer has multiple tabs, where each tab groups similar settings. These tabs are:

- General - select the object types to include in the query
- Storage - filter mailboxes
- Filter Criteria - specify a filter criteria to add objects to group membership
- Include/Exclude - specify objects to include or exclude in group membership, regardless of the query
- Database - combine an external data source with the directory to determine a group's membership
- Script - write scripts to manipulate group membership
- Password Expiry Options - available for Smart Groups with a password expiry condition

You can hide any of these tabs from role members.

NOTE: The General tab is displayed to all users and cannot be hidden. However, you can hide the objects displayed on it, as discussed in the [Limit the Objects for Use in a Query](#limit-the-objects-for-use-in-a-query) topic.

__To hide a tab:__

1. In Admin Center, click __Identity Stores__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Identity Stores__ page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select __Edit__.
3. Click __Security Roles__ under __Settings__ in the left pane.
4. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Edit__ for a security role.
5. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Specify policies for the members__ in the __Policies__ area.
6. On the __Add Policies__ pane, click the __Query Designer__ tab.
7. The __Tabs__ area lists the tabs available on the Query Designer, except the General tab. By default, all tabs are selected, indicating that they are displayed to role members.  
   Clear the check box for a tab to hide it from role members.
8. Click __OK__.
9. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Update Security Role__.
10. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Save__.

## Restrict the Attributes and Operators for Building a Query

By default, all schema attributes are displayed to role members for creating a filter criterion for the query (see the __Filter Criteria__ tab of the Query Designer). You can:

- limit the list of attributes to be displayed to role members
- limit the operators that role members can apply to an attribute

__To allow specific attributes and operators:__

1. In Admin Center, click __Identity Stores__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Identity Stores__ page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select __Edit__.
3. Click __Security Roles__ under __Settings__ in the left pane.
4. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Edit__ for a security role.
5. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Specify policies for the members__ in the __Policies__ area.
6. On the __Add Policies__ pane, click the __Query Designer__ tab.
7. Click __Edit Allowed Attributes__ in the __Attributes__ area.  
   The __Allowed Attributes__ dialog box is displayed. By default, all attributes are selected. This indicates that all attributes are available to role members on the __Filter Criteria__ tab of the Query Designer for creating queries.

   - Clear the check boxes for the attributes that you do not want to display to role members. Use the search box to search for your required attributes.
   - You can also clear the __Allow all attributes__ check box to deny all attributes, then select the check boxes for the required attributes. At least one attribute must be selected.
8. For each attribute, you can specify the operator(s) that can be applied to the attribute on the __Filter Criteria__ tab.  
   On the __Allowed Attributes__ dialog box, click the plus sign next to an attribute and select the check box for the operators you want to provide for the attribute. When role members select an attribute, only the respective operators will be displayed for it. For example, if you allow the âContainsâ and âEqualsâ operators for the âcnâ attribute, then only these operators will be displayed when role members select the âcnâ attribute.

   NOTE: This schema attribute setting will override the schema attribute setting specified on the Smart Group Attribute page in portal's design settings. See the [ Specify Smart Group Query Attributes](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/portal/design/queryattributes.md) topic.
9. Click __Save Selection__ on the __Allowed Attributes__ dialog box. The __Attributes__ area displays the allowed attributes count.   
   To view or update the allowed attributes, click __Edit Allowed Attributes__. On the __Allowed Attributes__ dialog box, select the __Show only selected__ check box to get a list of the allowed attributes. Make the desired changes and close the dialog box.
10. Click __OK__.
11. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Update Security Role__.
12. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Save__.

## Specify a Default Filter Criteria

Role members can specify a filter criterion on the __Filter Criteria__ tab of the Query Designer to determine a group's membership. This criteria is created using an attribute, operator, and a value. For example, the following criterion will add the users in the Human Resources department to the membership of the group.

Attribute: department  
Operator: Equals  
Value: Human Resources

You can specify a default criteria, that will be displayed to role members on the __Filter Criteria__ tab. They can change it as required

NOTE: If you have limited the attributes and operators for role members, then only the allowed attributes and operators are available to create a default filter criteria.

__To specify a default filter criteria:__

1. In Admin Center, click __Identity Stores__ in the left pane.
2. On the __Identity Stores__ page, click the ellipsis button for an identity store and select __Edit__.
3. Click __Security Roles__ under __Settings__ in the left pane.
4. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Edit__ for a security role.
5. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Specify policies for the members__ in the __Policies__ area.
6. On the __Add Policies__ pane, click the __Query Designer__ tab.
7. Click __Add Filter__ in the __Default Filter Criteria__ area. A row is displayed for adding a default criterion.

   - Select a schema attribute in the first drop-down list (for example, _title_).
   - Select an operator in the second drop-down list (for example, _Equals_).
   - Enter a value for the attribute in the third box (for example, _Manager_).

   With this filter, the query would fetch users whose job titles are set to Manager. Role members can change it as required.
8. You can also create an advanced query by adding more rows and applying the __AND__ or __OR__ operator to group them. See steps 1-2 in the Advanced Filter section of the [Designate a Criterion for the Search Scope](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/securityrole/policy/search.md#designate-a-criterion-for-the-search-scope) topic.   
   After creating a query, you can:

   - Click __Preview__ to get a list of the objects fetched by the query created by the current settings on the __Query Designer__ tab, namely the start-in container, objects, and default filter criteria.
   - Click __Clear__ to delete the default filter criteria.
9. Click __OK__ on the __Query Designer__ tab.
10. On the __Edit Security Role__ page, click __Update Security Role__.
11. On the __Security Roles__ page, click __Save__.
