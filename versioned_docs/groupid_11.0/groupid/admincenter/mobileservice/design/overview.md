# Design Settings

With identity stores associated with a Mobile service, GroupID enables you to define design settings for each of the identity stores. When users configure the GroupID app with a Mobile service or an instance of the service, the design settings apply to the app. In this way, the app offers a different design and functionality for each linked identity store.

You can customize the following design settings for an identity store associated with a Mobile service:

- Directory Search: specify the schema attributes whose values will be matched when users perform a search in the app. See the [Manage Search Attributes](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/mobileservice/design/quicksearch.md) topic.
- Search Results: control the fields to be displayed on the search results pages in the app. See the [Customize the Search Results Pages](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/mobileservice/design/searchresults.md) topic.
- Object Properties: control what properties of directory objects (user, group) you want to display in the app. See the [Customize Object Properties Pages](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/mobileservice/design/objectproperties.md) topic.
- Permissions: grant permissions on different functions of the app to security roles in an identity store. See the [Grant Permissions to Security Roles](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/mobileservice/design/permissions.md) topic.
- Property Validation: manage the fields (schema attributes) that users must review and update while validating their profiles using the app. See the [Manage Property Validation](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/mobileservice/design/propertyvalidation.md) topic.
