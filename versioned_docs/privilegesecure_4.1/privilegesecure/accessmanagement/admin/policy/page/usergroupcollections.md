# User and Group Collections Page

The User and Group Collection page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Users & Group. It shows session information for user and group collections. To gain access to the Privilege Secure console, users or groups have to be added in the top level [Users & Groups Page](/versioned_docs/privilegesecure_4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/usersgroups.md).

Collections are conglomerated users and groups (that have already been granted rights in the console) that will gain the same rights collectively. Like users and groups individually, collections can also be added to policies. Collections are helpful as they allow multiple roles to be assigned in a single action in the console. The information in the User and Group Collections table is also displayed on the __Users Dashboard__.
