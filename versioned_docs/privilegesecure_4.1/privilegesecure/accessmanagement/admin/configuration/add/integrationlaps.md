# LAPS Integration

Privilege Secure contains a built-in vault for credential management, but can uniquely map to a LAPS
vault. The Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) provides management of local account
passwords of domain joined computers. Passwords are stored in Active Directory. The LAPS vault
connector can be used for connecting as a service account for host scans, and for activities where
the local Administrator account is required.

## Install LAPS in Your Active Directory Domain

Install LAPS in your Active Directory domain and configure the desired hosts to connect to with
Privilege Secure to use LAPS. LAPS limits which users have access to the password attributes that
are contained in Active Directory. Make sure to create an account for Privilege Secure to use that
has appropriate rights. Set the rights for a user with the Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission cmdlet.
This cmdlet is included in the LAPS installation package which can be downloaded from the
[Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899).
