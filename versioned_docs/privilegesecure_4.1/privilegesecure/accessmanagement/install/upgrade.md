# Upgrade Procedure

This chapter describes the basic steps needed to upgrade Netwrix Privilege Secure.

__NOTE:__ As part of the upgrade process, the Privilege Secure installer will complete a mandatory encryption key rotation. Customers who are running Privilege Secure in high-availability mode or use distributed Action Service or Proxy components should refer to the[ Upgrading to Privilege Secure (fomerly SbPAM) 3.6 or Higher - High Availability and Remote Services Configurations](https://kb.netwrix.com/8422) knowledge base article before beginning an upgrade.

## Considerations

- It is not necessary to uninstall the previous version of Privilege Secure. The new version can be installed directly over the previous version.
- Canceling, exiting, or otherwise halting the installer during an upgrade may result in irreparable damage to the Privilege Secure database and loss of data.
- If your server has PostgreSQL 10 installed from a previous version of Privilege Secure, contact [Netwrix Support](https://www.netwrix.com/support.html) before proceeding with your upgrade.
- There are two installation paths to support either PostgreSQL server or Microsoft SQL server databases.

  - PostgreSQL — If you are upgrading and want to continue using PostgreSQL, follow the standard upgrade procedure.
  - Microsoft SQL — The Advanced checkbox provides the option to switch the database to Microsoft SQL Server.

    __CAUTION:__ This is an advanced configuration and requires additional support from Netwrix.

## Upgrade Procedure

Follow the steps to upgrade Netwrix Privilege Secure from an existing version.

__NOTE:__ Prior to upgrading Privilege Secure, the installer will scan for the current version PostgreSQL and prompt you to upgrade if needed.

__CAUTION:__ During an upgrade, the process updates both the application and the database. This process can take a significant amount of time, depending on the volume of data stored in the database. Canceling, exiting, or otherwise halting the installer during this step may result in irreparable damage to the Privilege Secure database and loss of data.

__Step 1 –__ Install the new version of Privilege Secure by running the NPS_Setup.exe as an administrator.

__NOTE:__ A server restart will be required after the installer in complete. A notification in the installer will display after the upgrade procedure is complete.

__Step 2 –__ Clear the browser cache after the upgrade procedure. This helps to prevent conflicts when logging in to the new version of Privilege Secure.

__Step 3 –__ Open the Privilege Secure Console and log in.

The latest version of Privilege Secure is now installed.
