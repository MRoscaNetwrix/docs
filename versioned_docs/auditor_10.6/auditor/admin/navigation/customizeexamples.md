## Run Search and Create Alert

__Step 1 –__ On the main Auditor page, click the Search Activity Records tile.

__Step 2 –__ Specify search filters to narrow your search results. See the [Use Filters in Simple Mode](/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/auditor/admin/search/filtersimple.md) topic for additional information.
