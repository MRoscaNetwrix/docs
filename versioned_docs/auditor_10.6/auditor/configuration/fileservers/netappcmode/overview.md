# NetApp Data ONTAP

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

__CAUTION:__ Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See the [Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html) knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.

  - To use this option for NetApp Clustered Data ONTAP 8 or ONTAP 9, make sure that audit configuration has been created (with ```vserver audit create``` command) for the target system enabling audit configuration is optional.
- Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or configure them manually:

  - On the NetApp device:

    - CIFS Network Protocol support is required.
    - Qtree Security must be configured. The volume where the audited file shares are located must be set to the _"ntfs"_ or _"mixed"_ security style.
    - On Clustered Data ONTAP 8 and ONTAP 9:

      - ```External Web Services: true```.

        ___RECOMMENDED:___ For security reasons, enable only SSL access.
      - Firewall policy for data interfaces must be configured to allow ONTAPI protocol connections.
      - Audit settings must be configured as follows:

        | Audit Setting | Configuration |
        | --- | --- |
        | Auditing State: | true |
        | Log Destination Path | /audit |
        | Categories of Events to Audit | file-ops, cifs-logon-logoff |
        | Log Format | evtx |
        | Log File Size Limit | 300 MB |
    - On Data ONTAP 7 and Data ONTAP 8 in 7-mode:

      - The ```httpd.admin.enable``` or the ```httpd.admin.ssl.enable``` option must be set to _"on"_. For security reasons, it is recommended to configure SSL access and enable the ```httpd.admin.ssl.enable``` option.
      - The ```cifs.audit.liveview.enable``` option must be set to _"off"_.
      - The ```cifs.audit.enable``` and the ```cifs.audit.file_access_events.enable``` options must be set to _"on"_.
      - Unless you are going to audit logon events, the ```cifs.audit.logon_events.enable``` and the ```cifs.audit.account_mgmt_events.enable``` options must be set to _"off"_.
      - The Security log must be configured:

        - ```cifs.audit.logsize 300 000 000 (300 MB)```
        - ```cifs.audit.autosave.onsize.enable on```
        - ```cifs.audit.autosave.file.extension timestamp```
    - Audit settings must be configured for CIFS File Shares. For a security principal (e.g., Everyone), the following options must be set to "Success" and "Fail" in the Advanced Security → Auditing settings for the audited shared folders:

      - List Folder / Read Data (Files only)
      - Create Files / Write Data
      - Create Folders / Append Data
      - Write Extended Attributes
      - Delete Subfolders and Files
      - Delete
      - Change Permissions
      - Take Ownership
  - On the Auditor console computer:

    - If your file shares contain symbolic links and you want to collect state-in-time data for these shares, the local-to-local, local-to-remote, remote-to-local, and remote-to-remote symbolic link evaluations must be enabled on the computer that hosts Auditor Server.

The following table lists the actions that can be performed on NetApp:

|  | File | Folder | Share |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Added | + | + | + |
| Add (failed attempt) | – | – | – |
| Modified | + | + | + |
| Modify (failed attempt) | + | + | – |

Actions marked with an asterisks (\*) are reported for NetApp Clustered Data ONTAP 8 and ONTAP 9 only.

## Configure NetApp Clustered Data ONTAP 8 and ONTAP 9 for Monitoring

To configure Clustered Data ONTAP 8 and ONTAP 9 for monitoring, perform the following procedures:

- [Prerequisites ](#prerequisites)
- [Configure ONTAPI\RESTAPI Web Access](/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/auditor/configuration/fileservers/netappcmode/webaccess.md#configure-ontapirestapi-web-access)
- [Configure System Service Firewall Policies](/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/auditor/configuration/fileservers/netappcmode/ports.md#configure-system-service-firewall-policies)
- [Configure Service Policy](/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/auditor/configuration/fileservers/netappcmode/servicepolicy.md#configure-service-policy)

### Prerequisites

Netwrix assumes that you are aware of basic installation and configuration steps. If not, refer to the following administration and management guides.

| ONTAP 9.0 - 9.10 | - [ONTAP 9 Documentation Center](http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/index.jsp) |

Perform the following steps before proceeding with the audit configuration.

__Step 1 –__ Configure CIFS server and make sure it functions properly.

__NOTE__: NFS file shares are not supported.

__Step 2 –__ Configure System Access Control List (SACL) on your file share. See [Configure Audit Settings for CIFS File Shares](/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/auditor/configuration/fileservers/netappcmode/cifs.md) topic for additional information.

__Step 3 –__ Set the Security Style for Volume or Qtree where the audited file shares are located to the _"ntfs"_ or _"mixed"_.

__Step 4 –__ Configure audit manually. For 8.3, review the Auditing NAS events on SVMs with FlexVol volumes section in [Clustered Data ONTAP® 8.3 File Access Management Guide for CIFS.](https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMP1610207)

__NOTE:__ The current version of Netwrix Auditor does not support auditing of Infinite Volumes.
