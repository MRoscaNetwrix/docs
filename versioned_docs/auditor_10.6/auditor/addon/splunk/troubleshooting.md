# Maintenance and Troubleshooting

Splunk records service logs to the _internal index. Follow the steps to troubleshoot data input from Netwrix Auditor API:

__Step 1 窶点_ Navigate to the Search page of the add-on or Search & Reporting Splunk app.

__Step 2 窶点_ Enter the search command:

```
index=_internal "<data_input_name>"
```

For example:

```
index=_internal "<netwrix_data_input>"
```

__Step 3 窶点_ Press the Last 24 hours button and choose Last 15 minutes time range.

__Step 4 窶点_ Press the search button; you should see list of the events with Splunk service information.

When the add-on operates normally there should be no errors and the following types of events should appear regularly:

- Regular events from _\*splunk\ta-netwrix-auditor-add-on-for-splunk_netwrix_auditor_api_input_\*_ source with POST requests to the Netwrix Auditor API.
- Regular events from _\*splunk\ta-netwrix-auditor-add-on-for-splunk_netwrix_auditor_api_input_\*_ source with checkpoint update with new ContinuationMarks received from Netwrix Auditor API.
- Events from _\*\splunk\metrics.log_ source with information about indexed volumes.
