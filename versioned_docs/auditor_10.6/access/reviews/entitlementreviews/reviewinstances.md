# Review Instances

After a review has been completed, it can be run again, which creates multiple instances of the review. Each instance is identified by date timestamps indicating its start and end times.

___RECOMMENDED:___ Prior to running another review instance, ensure the most up to date information is available to owners for review.

On the Manage Reviews page in the Entitlement Reviews interface, a review with a Completed status can be started again. Select the review and click __Run Again__. The Create Review wizard opens without the Review Type page. The review can be run as-is by navigating through the wizard with the __Next__ buttons, or you can modify as desired. Completing the wizard process restarts the review. See the [Create Review Wizard](/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/access/reviews/entitlementreviews/wizard/create.md) topic for additional information.
