# Logbook

The logbook in the footer of the __Discovery Service Task__ is extremely helpful for checking the __Discovery Service Task__. Information about the progress of the __Discovery Service Task__ is displayed here. The data is displayed both in the __footer__ and also in the __logbook module__ (although in more detail here). To display the footer, the user requires the __user right__: Global settings in the [User settings](/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/user_settings/user_settings.md) in the category: "Footer area" - "Show logbook in the footer area (activated)"

## Show in footer

The following __events__ are displayed in the __logbook for the footer__ and in the __logbook module__:

1. New
2. Change
3. Execute
4. Execution completed
5. Error during execution

If an error occurs during the execution of the __Discovery Service Task__, this is also shown n the __logbook for the footer__ with __additional information__ about the error.

## Display in the logbook

In general, the __logbook module__ displays more detailed information about the __Discovery Service Task__. The [Filter](/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/filter/filter.md) can be used to select which data is displayed. The same __events__ as for the footer for the __Discovery Service Task__ are also used here.

The column editor can be used to arrange and display the data in the table according to their importance.
