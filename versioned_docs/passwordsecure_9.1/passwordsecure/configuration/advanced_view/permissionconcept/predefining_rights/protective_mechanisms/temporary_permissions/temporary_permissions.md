# Temporary permissions

## What are temporary permissions?

So far, we have covered permissions that were valid for an unlimited period. However, a permission
can also be granted in advance with a time restriction. Examples are users who stay in the company
for a limited time, such as interns or trainees.

## Configuration

When configuring the
[Manual setting of permissions](/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/permissionconcept/manual_settings/manual_setting_of_permissions.md),
you can specify a temporary release for each role. The start date as well as the end date is
selected here. You can start the configuration using the **Extras** area in the ribbon.

In this example, the role "trainees" was granted the read permission to a data set for two weeks.

## Color scheme

The colors in the "time period" column provide information on the current status of the granted
permissions:

- **Brown:** The temporary permission is configured but is still inactive. The selected time period
  is still in the future.
- **Green:** The temporary permission is active.
- **Red:** The time period for the temporary permissions has already expired.

NOTE: Temporary permissions can also be assigned to multiple roles and users at the same time. You
can select multiple users and roles as usual with Ctrl/Shift + left mouse button!

## Special features of the authorization system

Due to their very nature, temporary permissions leave lots of potential for incorrect
configurations. Conceivable constellations include a situation when the only user with all rights
only has temporary permissions. When these permissions expire, there is no longer any user with full
permissions. To prevent this happening, users with temporary permissions are handled differently.

**CAUTION:** There must always be one user who has the “authorize” right to a record, who does not
only have temporary permissions.
