# ECC Migration

For a better overview the ECC migration is organized in two sections. One for the administrators and one for the end user:

- [Admin Manual](/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/server_manager/ecc_migration/ecc_migration_administrator_manual.md)
- [User Manual](/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/server_manager/ecc_migration/ecc_migration_user_manual.md)
