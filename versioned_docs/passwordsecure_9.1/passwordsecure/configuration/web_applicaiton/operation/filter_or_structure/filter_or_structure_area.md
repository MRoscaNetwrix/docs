# Filter or structure area

As is also the case on the client, it is possible to select between filter and structure. For this purpose, the following buttons are available on the navigation bar

1. Filter

The filter on the Web Application is based on the [Filter](/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/operation_and_setup/filter/filter.md). Therefore, only those characteristics specific to the Web Application will be described here.

Using the filter

Operation of the “Web Application filter” barely differs from the operation of the client filter. It is only necessary to note that the Clear filter and Apply filter buttons can be found above the filter. The configuration settings can also be found directly above the Web Application filter.

Configuring the filter

The configuration for the filter can be displayed via the following buttons:

![installation_with_parameters_170](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/web_applicaiton/operation/filter_or_structure/installation_with_parameters_170.png)

New filter groups can be added using __Add filter groups__ and the current filter can be reset using __Reset filter. Advanced mode__ provides you with the possibility of deleting or moving individual filter groups. The __Allow negation of filters__ option can also be selected.

2. Structure

The structure can be operated in precisely the same way as on the client.
