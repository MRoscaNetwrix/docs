# Password Management

In principle, there are two types of passwords. __Global__ and __personal__ passwords.

#### Global passwords

Global passwords are passwords that are assigned to an organizational unit. These passwords are usually used by more than one user.

Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met in order to create new global passwords:

- User right __Can create new passwords__
- __Add right__ to the corresponding organizational unit

#### Personal passwords

Personal passwords are passwords to which only the creating user is authorized.

Requirement

The following user rights are required to create personal passwords:

- Can create new passwords
- Can create personal records

#### Create passwords

When creating a new record, it is necessary to know whether it is a personal or a global password. Because according to this criterion you should select the appropriate tab and click on the + located in the upper right corner.

After that, select the required __form__.

Then, once you have filled in all the relevant information of the selected form, one click on __Save__ is enough to create the password.

To edit a password, click on the corresponding password and select the pencil icon.

As soon as you click on the pencil icon again in the new window, in the so-called read-only view, you can edit all existing fields.

Passwords can currently only be deleted via the Full- or Web Application.

#### Tags

Tags can be added or removed both when creating and editing a password.

It is also possible to create a completely new tag.

This is possible by searching in the tag selection in the search field for a tag that does not already exist.

You will then be offered the option of creating this previously non-existent tag.
