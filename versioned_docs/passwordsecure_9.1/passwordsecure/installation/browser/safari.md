## Installing the add-on

The Safari Add-on can be downloaded from the following link:
[Add-on Safari](https://download.passwordsafe.de/v9/Netwrix_Password_Secure-9.0.3.dmg).

To install it, simply double-click on the downloaded file. A window will open where you then only need to drag and drop the Netwrix Password Secure logo onto the applications.
