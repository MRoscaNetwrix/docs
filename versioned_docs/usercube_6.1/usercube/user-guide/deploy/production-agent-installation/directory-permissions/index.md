# Set the Working Directory's Permissions

This guide shows how to assign to the pool the right permissions on the working directory.

## Overview

For Usercube to work correctly, the pool of the production agent must be configured with specific permissions on the working directory.

This page describes the optimal configuration of the pool's permissions on the working directory to prepare the production agent's installation.

## Set the Working Directory's Permissions

Set the working directory's permissions by proceeding as follows:

1. Right-click on the working directory, for example ```C:/Usercube```, to select __Properties__, and in the __Security__ tab, click on __Advanced__.

2. In the __Permissions__ tab, click on __Add__, and in the pop-up window click on __Select a principal__.

3. Click on __Locationsï¿½__ to choose the current computer, and in the text area enter ```iis apppool/Usercube``` (```Usercube``` being the name of the previously created pool).

   An error at this point should come either from a mistake in the pool's name or in the selected location.
4. Click on __OK__ and make sure that only the __Read and execute__, __List folder contents__ and __Read__ permissions are selected.

5. Click on __OK__ in the windows until they are all closed.
6. Right-click on the ```Temp``` folder to select __Properties__, and in the __Security__ tab, click on __Edit__.

8. Click on __OK__ in the windows until they are all closed.
9. Repeat the last few steps (those concerning the ```Temp``` folder) to apply them to the ```Work``` and ```Mails``` folders.
