# Define Navigation Properties

How to define the properties which describe the [entity type](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/metadata/entitytype/index.md)'s relationships to other entity types.

## Overview

Here you will learn to define navigation properties, which contain scalar values just like [scalar properties](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/scalar-property-definition/index.md), but which are also linked to and point to other properties, from the same entity type or to another entity type.

> For example, ```memberOf``` can contain a list of groups thus linking a user to groups, and a group to other groups. In the UI, ```memberOf``` is displayed just like scalar properties, but you can click on its values to access each group in the list. Here for the AD entry ```ADM Vidal Pierre```:
>
> ![Navigation Property - memberOf](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/navigation-property-definition/entitytypecreation_memberof_v600.png)
>
> Clicking on one of these groups will display said group's properties including the other side of the ```memberOf``` property, called ```member```, which contains the list of users and groups which are members of the group. Here for the AD group ```SG_APP_RAY_0_LDAP_READLDSFEDE```:
>
> ![Navigation Property - member](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/navigation-property-definition/entitytypecreation_member_v600.png)

> As another example, a department needs to be linked to a manager who is an existing user. So the user identifier is used in the ```Manager``` property to create the link between the department and the manager/user. In the UI, when looking at a given department data, ```Manager``` is displayed just like scalar properties, but you can click on its value to access the page of the department's manager.

>
> Clicking on the manager will display said user's properties including the ```Department``` property, which points back to the managed department.

Navigation properties can create a link:

- inside an entity type;
- between two entity types from the same connector;
- between two entity types from different connectors.

Inside Usercube, a navigation property has a flip side, one for each linked element.
  
For example in the AD, the group membership of a user is represented by the properties ```member``` for groups (containing a list of users) and ```memberOf``` for users (containing a list of groups).  
However, some managed systems only have one of these two sides.
  
The AD only uses ```member``` from among groups' properties. Users don't have a ```memberOf``` property.  
But, as Usercube uses and links both sides, it is able to "translate" the information, so that a navigation property, which actually exists in the managed system, can be linked to the two corresponding navigation properties in Usercube.
  
When importing data to Usercube, the ```member``` property from the AD will update the ```member``` property in Usercube, and Usercube will update the ```memberOf``` property accordingly.

Most often, properties inside Usercube are each linked to a property from the managed system. This way, data from the managed system can be imported into Usercube and stored in the corresponding property. These properties are mapped from the source (see step 3).
  
If the property to be created does not exist in the external source, it is impossible to map the property, but it can still be created with __+ Add a navigation property__.
  
This can be used to store data needed for assignment management, but which you cannot write to the connected system. Since these properties do not exist in the connected system, they cannot be written or read.
  
[See the example for scalar properties](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/scalar-property-definition/index.md#see-the-example-for-scalar-properties).

## Define the Entity Type's Navigation Properties

Define the entity type's navigation properties by proceeding as follows:

1. Start by [declaring the entity type](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/entity-type-declaration/index.md).
2. In the entity type's __Properties__ section, click on __Navigation Properties__ tab.
3. Click on __Map a navigation property__ to display existing columns from the external source, and select the properties to be used as navigations in the entity type.
4. Fill in the information fields.

   ![Navigation Properties](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/navigation-property-definition/entitytypecreation_navigationproperties_v602.png)

   If you map a column from the source, then the first line of the navigation property is about said column. The second line is about the new property to be linked to the first one, always of the entity type.

   - __APPLICATION METADATA__: fields about the display of the properties inside Usercube.

     - ```Identifier```: must be unique among properties, without any whitespace, and be C#-compatible. [See Microsoft lexical structure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/lexical-structure#see-microsoft-lexical-structure).
     - ```Entity Type```: always the entity type for the second property, but the first property can be mapped from any existing entity type in the application.
     - ```Storage Indicator```: describes the association that can be __mono-valued__ (meaning 1-to-1 or many-to-1) or __multi-valued__ (meaning 1-to-many or many-to-many).

       For one entity type, Usercube can store up to 25 optimized mono-valued navigation properties. For performance purposes, NETWRIX recommends choosing ```optimized mono-valued``` as a storage indicator as often as possible.
         
       If the entity type contains more than 25 mono-valued properties, then a priority must be established, choosing to optimize:
         
       1. properties displayed in forms and search bars;
         
       2. properties used for the computation of expressions and the role model;
         
       3. other properties.
     - ```Name```: will be displayed in the UI to identify the property.

       __Names and identifiers__:
         
       A mono-valued property is supposed to be written in the singular, a multi-valued property is supposed to be plural. This convention facilitates maintenance.
         
       Entity properties' names and identifiers cannot be "Id".
   - __EXTERNAL SYSTEM__: fields about the corresponding properties inside the connected application.

     - ```Source```: connection that leads to the source file(s).

       You can __choose the source__ of a new navigation property by:
         
       - mapping the property from source so that the connection table is automatically selected as the table from this entity type;
         
       - opening the dropdown list to choose a connection table from among the other entity types from this connector;
         
       - clicking on the search icon to choose a connection table from among all other connectors.
     - ```Source Column```: column in the external system where the property data comes from.
     - ```Column Content```: property of the source column used to identify any resource in the association.

       > For example, the source column ```manager``` contains the ```dn``` of users to make the association, thus we choose ```dn``` as the source content.
   > For example, ```AD - Entry``` uses the following navigation properties:
   >
   > ```Entries```; ```assistant```; ```assistantOf```; ```manager```; ```directReports```; ```memberOf```; ```member```; ```parentdn```; ```children```.
   >

5. Click on the Gear symbol to add advanced settings if needed.

   - ```Icon```: can be chosen from [Microsoft's list](https://uifabricicons.azurewebsites.net/) and will be displayed with the property among users' data.
   - __Source Expression__: expression that defines the property based on at least one source object. Can be defined by a property path and/or an [expression](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/expressions/index.md).

     > For example, the scalar property ```isUnused``` is created to spot unused accounts via a combination of ```accountExpires``` and ```lastLogonTimestamp```:
     >
     > ![Advanced Settings](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/scalar-property-definition/entitytypecreation_sourceexpressionexample_v60.png)
   - ```Flexible Comparison Expression```: expression that inserts adaptable [comparison flexibility](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/index.md#comparison-flexibility) when using a searchbar for the property.
   - ```History Precision```: time period over which Usercube historically records only one value.

     > For example, the scalar property ```lastLogonTimestamp``` of an AD resource is modified every time the user connects to the application. Every modification triggers the historization of all properties for said resource inside the database. Hence, the database can quickly become full of data. In order to lighten the database, we can set the ```History Precision``` option to one week (10080 minutes) so that resources are historized once a week at most (concerning changes on ```lastLogonTimestamp```). In the meantime, in case of a change, instead of historizing resources with all their properties, only ```lastLogonTimestamp``` is updated with the new value.

   Clicking on __Continue__ closes the pop-up window so that you can continue the configuration of the entity type. But it does not save anything.

## Reload

Every time an entity type mapping is modified and saved, a green pop-up appears saying that you should reload the schema to implement the changes. You do not need to click on the button every time. It is essential though to reload after the final changes are made.

![Reload](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/key-selection/entitytypecreation_reload_v522.png)

The __Reload__ button mostly enables your changes to appear in the menu items, which configure the left menu links on the UI's home page.

You can find the __Reload__ button either on the green warning, or on the connector's dashboard.

## Next Steps

After the entity type is created with its scalar properties and keys, and navigation properties, you can [set the resources' display names](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/set-up/connect-system/entity-type-creation/display-name-setting/index.md).
