# Access Certification

The Access Certification module enables chosen end-users to carry out assignment certification campaigns, which aim to certify assignments of entitlements.

## Overview

The aim of an access certification campaign is to review specific entitlement assignments for specific identities, in order to certify them and express an audit opinion that justifies their necessity. So, for all relevant permissions, the idea is to specify if these assignments ought to be deleted or not.

There are several ways to arrange an access certification campaign. Among others, through filters you can choose to focus on:

- a certain category of roles;
- a certain type of assignment;
- assignments not certified since a certain date;
- assignments presenting a certain level of [risk](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/user-guide/optimize/risk-management/index.md).

Usercube uses an access certification campaign to define the campaign's scope including:

- the start and end date of the campaign;
- the group of entitlement assignments to be certified during the campaign.

Every entitlement assignment to be certified is represented in the database by an access certification item, created along with a new campaign, according to [access certification data filters](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-certification/accesscertificationdatafilter/index.md) and [access certification owner filters](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-certification/accesscertificationownerfilter/index.md).

The relevant database tables are prefixed with ```US_```.

### Job for access certification

After the campaign's creation, access certification items are assigned to reviewers (Usercube end-users) by the [```CreateAccessCertificationJob```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/jobs/createaccesscertificationjob/index.md), composed of the following tasks:

1. [```Usercube-Update-AccessCertificationCampaign```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/updateaccesscertificationcampaigntask/index.md) simply applies the campaign's scope, determines which permissions are to be certified, by computing certification orders;
2. [```Usercube-Set-AccessCertificationReviewer```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/setaccesscertificationreviewertask/index.md) assigns one review for each access certification item to end-users whose profile's scope of responsibility matches the entitlement to be certified;
3. [```Usercube-Send-AccessCertificationNotification```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/sendaccesscertificationnotificationtask/index.md) sends notifications to concerned reviewers.
4. [```Usercube-Process-AccessCertificationItems```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/jobs/tasks/server/processaccesscertificationitemstask/index.md) processes the access certification item decisions and generates the corresponding deprovisioning orders.

## Set up the Configuration

Configuring the Access Certification module entails:

- setting up profiles to carry out the certification;
- configuring their scope of responsibility;
- enabling automatic and forwarded assignments of access certification items to end-users.

### Campaign creation

At least one Usercube profile needs permissions to create campaigns.

Such permission can be granted using the [```AccessReviewAdministrationAccessControlRules```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/accesscontrolrules/accessreviews/accessreviewadministrationaccesscontrolrules/index.md) scaffolding.

The administrator profile, created with [```CreateAdministratorProfile```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/templates/createadministratorprofile/index.md) scaffolding, already has these permissions.

If you are not using the [```AccessReviewAdministrationAccessControlRules```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/accesscontrolrules/accessreviews/accessreviewadministrationaccesscontrolrules/index.md) scaffolding, the user cannot query on dimensions when editing the [owner filters](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-certification/accesscertificationownerfilter/index.md), so you need to give the permissions on the correct contexts:

```

<AccessControlRule Profile="Administrator" EntityType="Dimension0" Identifier="Administrator_AccessCertificationCampaign_Dimension0" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_AccessCertificationCampaigns">  <Entry Permission="/AccessCertification/AccessCertificationCampaign/Create" />  <Entry Permission="/AccessCertification/AccessCertificationCampaign/Update" /></AccessControlRule>

```

### Profile scope of responsibility

The scope of responsibility of a profile is a set of criteria that defines which assignment of entitlements this profile will certify. For example, the ```Manager``` profile is responsible for reviewing entitlement assignments of identities working in their department.

A profile's scope of responsibility is configured by giving access, with [access control rules](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/index.md), to a specific set of access certification items that match the profile's scope of responsibility criteria.

##### Example

This example shows how to set the scope of responsibility for the ```Manager``` profile.

```

<AccessControlRule Identifier="Manager_AccessCertificationItem_Custom_AccessCertification_AutoAssign_Directory_User"
  DisplayName_L1="Organization Manager - Access certification auto assign"
  EntityType="AccessCertificationItem"
  Profile="Manager">    <Filter Binding="Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.Organization.Id" Dimension="Organization0" />    ...
</AccessControlRule>

```

The filter indicates that a review with the ```Manager``` profile can only access items for which the binding ```Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.Organization.Id``` matches their dimension ```organization0```'s value.

This example needs to be completed with either automatic assignment or manual assignment capabilities.

For certification items to be assigned to a profile, a permission context has to be added to the access control rule.

### Access certification item assignments

Access certification items can be assigned to end-users via:

- Automatic assignments, computed by the reviewer-setting task when a given profile's scope of responsibility matches the entitlement to be certified;
- Forwarded assignments, automatically assigned to an end-user, but then manually forwarded to another user from the UI.

#### Automatic assignments

For a profile to be the target of an automatic assignment of an access certification item, it needs the ```/Custom/AccessCertification/AutoAssigned/{entityTypeName}``` permission.

##### Example

This example completes the previous one by adding the automatic assignment capabilities.

```

<AccessControlRule      Identifier="Manager_AccessCertificationItem_Custom_AccessCertification_AutoAssign_Directory_User"
  DisplayName_L1="Organization Manager - Access certification auto assign"
  EntityType="AccessCertificationItem"
  Profile="Manager">    <Filter Binding="Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.Organization.Id" Dimension="Organization0" />    <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/AccessCertification/AutoAssigned/Directory_User" /></AccessControlRule>

```

This example enables automatic assignments of access certification items that match the filter to end-users with the ```Manager``` profile.

If the filter criterion is matched for several end-users, only one is assigned the certification item, and this assignment is made randomly. Therefore, in order to have a cleaner reviewing architecture, it is recommended to carefully set the ```Filter``` attributes in the [access control rules](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/index.md) so that no two end-users' scope of responsibility overlap.

#### Forwarded assignments

The target profiles need the following ```/Custom/AccessCertification/ManualAssigned/{entityTypeName}``` permission.

##### Example

```

<AccessControlRule Identifier="Manager_AccessCertificationItem_Custom_AccessCertification_ManualAssign_Directory_User" DisplayName_L1="User - Access certification manual assign" EntityType="AccessCertificationItem" Profile="Manager">    <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/AccessCertification/ManualAssigned/Directory_User" />  </AccessControlRule>

```

This example allows the ```Manager``` profile to be the target of forwarded assignments.

There is no filter so the ```Manager``` profile can certify all forwarded certification orders for the ```Directory_User``` entity type, regardless of his previously configured scope of responsibility.

It is recommended to have a larger scope for forwarded certification orders than for automatically assigned ones.

### Certification policy

Scopes of responsibility can also be defined in terms of [access certification campaign policy](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-certification/accesscertificationcampaignpolicy/index.md).

Assigning an access certification campaign policy to an access certification campaign allows the creation of campaigns dedicated specifically to one set of reviewers.

The following example creates a new policy named ```Manager```.

```

<AccessCertificationCampaignPolicy Id="-2" Identifier="Manager" DisplayName_L1="Manager" DisplayName_L2="Responsable"/>

```

It automatically appears on the campaign creation screen, and binds itself to the created campaign:

![Campaign creation screen with policies](/img/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/governance/accesscertification/creation_5.1.6.png)

To use it, modify the [access control rules](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/index.md) by adding a filter on the campaign policy.

##### Example

```

<AccessControlRule
  Identifier="Manager_AccessCertificationItem_Custom_AccessCertification_AutoAssign_Directory_User"
  DisplayName_L1="Organization Manager - Access certification auto assign"
  EntityType="AccessCertificationItem"
  Profile="Manager">    <Filter Binding="Owner.Directory_User:MainRecord.Organization.Id" Dimension="Organization0" />    <Filter Binding="Campaign.Policy.Identifier" Value="Manager"/>    <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/AccessCertification/AutoAssigned/Directory_User" /></AccessControlRule>

```

In this example, the ```Manager``` profile is only able to certify items for a campaign defined with the ```Manager``` policy.

A default policy is already defined. If no filter is set when giving the permission, the policy is not considered.

### Access certification item processing

Once entitlement assignments have been reviewed (accepted or rejected), the final step is to apply these decisions with the processing task, eventually denying assignments. This is done through the UI.

The user needs to have the correct permission to launch the item processing:

```

<AccessControlRule Profile="Administrator" EntityType="AccessCertificationCampaign" Identifier="Administrator_AccessCertificationCampaign_Process" DisplayName_L1="Administrator_AccessCertificationCampaigns">  <Entry Permission="/AccessCertification/AccessCertificationCampaign/Process" /></AccessControlRule>

```

It is also possible to add [access control filters](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/index.md#access-control-filters) when creating the permission set so that users can only access certain type of campaigns.

This permission also is given by the [```AccessReviewAdministrationAccessControlRules```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/configuration/scaffoldings/accesscontrolrules/accessreviews/accessreviewadministrationaccesscontrolrules/index.md) scaffolding.
