# Review Prolonged Entitlements

This guide shows how to allow a manager to review the permissions prolonged by a grace period.

## Overview

Consider an entitlement given via a role which is defined with a grace period. Consider that this role is assigned automatically to some users by a rule of the role model. If this rule changes and the users are supposed to lose the role, then they keep it for the time defined by the [grace period](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.md), and the role's workflow state switches from ```Automatic``` to ```Prolonged```. Then a manager must access these entitlements in the __Role Review__ screen, to either approve or decline the role prolongation.

## Assign the Right to Review Prolonged Entitlements

The right to review prolonged entitlements is given by adding the appropriate ```AccessControlRule``` on a profile.
A profile should get the right to review prolonged entitlements given for both single and composite roles. Technically speaking, we need to create one access control rule for assigned single roles, and another one for assigned composite roles. In this case we give access to the workflow state 27 which is the workfow state ```Prolonged``` linked with the grace period.

```

 <AccessControlRule Profile="GracePeriodManager" EntityType="AssignedCompositeRole" Identifier="Manager_GracePeriod_CompositeRole" DisplayName_L1="Manager - Review Grace Period">    <Filter Binding="WorkflowState" Value="27"/>    <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/ProvisioningPolicy/ReviewRoles/Directory_User"/> </AccessControlRule> <AccessControlRule Profile="GracePeriodManager" EntityType="AssignedSingleRole" Identifier="Manager_GracePeriod_SingleRole" DisplayName_L1="Manager - Review Grace Period">    <Filter Binding="WorkflowState" Value="27"/>    <Entry CanExecute="true" Permission="/Custom/ProvisioningPolicy/ReviewRoles/Directory_User"/> </AccessControlRule>

```
