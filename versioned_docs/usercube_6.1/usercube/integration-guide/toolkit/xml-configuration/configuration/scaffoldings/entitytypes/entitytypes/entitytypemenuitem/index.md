# EntityTypeMenuItem

Creates a menu item for the entity type, and for its connector if the entity type has an entity type mapping.

You can create menu items this way in the menu items ```Nav```, ```Top``` and ```Dashboard```.

When choosing ```Nav```, it creates the connector's menu item under the ```Nav_Connectors``` menu item if you have it, otherwise it creates the connector's menu item under ```Nav```.
When choosing ```Top```, no menu item is created for the entity type's connector.

If the entity type already has a menu item in the given section (```Nav```, ```Top``` or ```Dashboard```), the scaffolding does not create any more menu item in this section.
If the entity type has no menu item in the given section, but the connector's menu item already exists in this section, the scaffolding creates only a menu item for the entity type, under the menu item of its connector.
