# Customize a Native Notification

This guide shows how to set a template other than the default one for native notifications.

## Overview

Usercube natively sends notifications for usual cases. [See more details](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/notifications/native/index.md).

These native notifications are based on cshtml templates available inside the ```Runtime``` folder. If the provided templates do not meet your exact needs, then they can be replaced by personalized templates.

## Customize a Native Notification

Customize a native notification by proceeding as follows:

1. Among the [list of all native notifications](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/notifications/notificationtemplate/index.md), get the identifier of the notification whose templates are to be replaced.

   > For example, to customize the notification for one-way password reset: ```OneWayPasswordReset```.
2. In ```Runtime/NotificationTemplates```, copy to the configuration folder the cshtml template(s) associated to the notification that need to be overridden.

   > For example, we can copy the template for the email's body but keep the provided template for the subject. Then we have: ```Conf/Templates/MyOneWayPasswordReset.cshtml```.
   >
   > Let's say that we also need to customize the email's subject in French which is the language 2: ```Conf/Templates/MyOneWayPasswordReset_Subject.fr.cshtml```
3. Customize the template(s) previously copied to the configuration folder.
4. Configure an XML element [```NotificationTemplate```](/versioned_docs/usercube_6.1/usercube/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/notifications/notificationtemplate/index.md) with the identifier collected at step 1, and the relative path(s) to the customized template(s).

   > For example:
   >
   > ```
   >
   > <NotificationTemplate Identifier="OneWayPasswordReset" BodyTemplate_L1="./Templates/MyOneWayPasswordReset.cshtml" SubjectTemplate_L2="./Templates/MyOneWayPasswordReset_Subject.fr.cshtml" />
   >
   > ```
