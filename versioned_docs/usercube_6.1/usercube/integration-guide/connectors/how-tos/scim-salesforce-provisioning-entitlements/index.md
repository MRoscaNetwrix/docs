# Provision Salesforce Users' Profiles via SCIM

This guide shows how to provision a user's account profile in a Salesforce system with the SCIM connector.

## Prerequisites

This guide supposes that you already have a working synchronization for Salesforce users' accounts, entitlements and links between accounts and entitlements.

## Context

In Salesforce, both ```profiles``` and ```permission sets``` are in the ```Entitlements``` entity, whereas they are not managed the same way: a user account must have a profile and only one, while it can have zero to several permission sets.

This implies a difference of treatment based on the entitlement's ```type```.

## Configuration

In order to handle this special case, Usercube expects, for now, a very precise configuration. A generic configuration element will come soon to be able to customize and apply this special treatment in other cases.

For now, for your ```EntityType``` representing Salesforce's ```Entitlements``` entity type, you need to have an entity property with exactly ```type``` as identifier:

```

    <Property Identifier="type" DisplayName_L1="Type" TargetColumnIndex="13" Type="String" />

```

And to map it in the ```Entitlements``` entity type mapping:

```

    <Property Identifier="type" ConnectionColumn="type" />

```

That is all you need to do. With the next synchronization, all the entitlements will have their ```type``` and then the special treatment can be done for those with the ```Profile``` type when provisioning users' entitlements.
