# Active Directory

Threat Prevention for Active Directory is a real-time change monitoring and security threat detection solution, designed to detect, protect, mitigate, and generate security intelligence without any reliance on native logging.

- From individual objects and attributes to Group Policies, Threat Prevention for Active Directory produces a complete audit trail of all change and access activities.
- It adds an additional security layer on top of native controls to proactively block undesired changes and guard against malicious attempts to comprise directory services.
- Through real-time analysis of all Active Directory authentication traffic, Threat Prevention also detects patterns of activity indicative of account compromise or impending breach.
- It provides the option to monitor for weak passwords created within the environment using the Monitoring function of the Password Enforcement module.

Some important events Threat Prevention captures are:

- Changes
- Account Lockouts
- Password Resets
- Comprised and Weak Password Use
- Group Policy Object (GPO) Modifications
- Object Moves/Adds/Deletes
- Permission Modifications
- Groups Membership
- DNS Changes
- LSASS Modifications
- AD Replication
- Replication Impersonations
- Active Directory Read Monitoring
- Authentication (Kerberos & NTLM)

  - Authentication-based Attacks (e.g. Horizontal/Lateral Movement, Brute Force Attacks, User Account Hacking, Breached Passwords, Golden Tickets, and more)
  - Privileged Account Authentications
