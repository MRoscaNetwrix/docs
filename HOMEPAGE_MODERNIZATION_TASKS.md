## üöÄ **Build Performance Optimizations Added**

### **Docusaurus 3.8 Faster Configuration:**
‚úÖ **SWC Compilation**: JavaScript transpilation and minification  
‚úÖ **Lightning CSS**: Fast CSS minification  
‚úÖ **Rspack Bundler**: Modern bundler replacing Webpack  
‚úÖ **Persistent Cache**: 2-5x faster rebuilds via `./node_modules/.cache`  
‚úÖ **MDX Cross-Compiler Cache**: Faster MDX processing  
‚úÖ **SSG Worker Threads**: 2x faster static site generation  
‚úÖ **V4 Future Flags**: CSS Cascade Layers and postBuild optimizations

### **Expected Performance Gains:**
- **Cold Builds**: 3-4x faster (vs baseline)
- **Warm Rebuilds**: 5-7x faster (vs baseline)  
- **Static Generation**: 2x faster with worker threads
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced peak consumption
- **Development**: Faster `docusaurus start` experience

### **Cache Preservation:**
The persistent cache requires preserving `./node_modules/.cache` across builds. Most CI/CD platforms (Netlify, Vercel) handle this automatically.
