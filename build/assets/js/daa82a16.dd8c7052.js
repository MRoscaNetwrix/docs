We're logging on as the same user for the very first time. I'm going to go ahead and wait for this to finish. And remember, this guy has never logged on before. Let's go ahead and run Firefox for the first time and see what happens. This: three tabs, one for the Start page, which has got nothing in there, and then two kinds of commercials from Firefox. And on Windows 10, if we go and take a look at experience, well, not only do we get the \"do you want to import stuff\", but by the time that's over you also get these annoying tabs, the Start page tab, which is fine, but then this kind of commercial-ly thing. \"So how do we make this stop?\" I hear you cry."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"All we're going to do is use PolicyPak to the rescue.

So, we're trying to save the next generation, or if people get a new machine, or things like that. Let's go ahead and log off here. Sign out of both of those guys. And let's use PolicyPak to fix this."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So for all of our sales people, we could do it on the computer or the user side. We will stop Firefox's annoying two extra tabs.

We'll go to computer side PolicyPak, application settings manager here, right-click \"new application\" and we'll do Firefox 23, which is really 23 and later. And right here on the \"general\" tab, let's go ahead and set the homepage to PolicyPak.com and we'll right-click it and lock it down so users can't work around it."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And then here are how to stop the launch tabs.

We'll go ahead and wait for this to finish. Okay, now that that's finished, let's go and first run for this guy for Firefox. Let's see what we get this time.
