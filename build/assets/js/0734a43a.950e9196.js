Almost everybody here will almost certainly be using the Group Policy Edition. It also works if you don't like Group Policy. You want to use SCCM or Altiris or whatever? That's great. We call it the Group Policy Edition, and that's totally fine. We also have the MDM Edition if you're flirting with Intune, Airwatch or MobileIron.

The first one is about desktop and rolling out big things in the first place, which is you've rolled out your desktop and that's great but now users start to drift from your configuration. If I just uncheck this checkbox, I can get past the proxy. Why are things asking for upgrades? If I just uncheck this checkbox, I can get around the site list exceptions."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The idea is you need to have a way to layer your settings and decouple that from your actual rollout. If your rollout is Citrix, if your rollout is desktop, if your rollout is VDI, if your rollout is non-domain joined machines \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 you need a way to decouple your image or your computer, basically, your applications from the settings."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We have a way to dynamically deliver the heck out of pretty much every application's settings \u2013 Firefox, Flash, Java, Internet Explorer, Chrome and so on \u2013 dynamically giving what I like to call your settings of the moment. If you change your mind two days from now, what are you going to do? Go back and rebuild that gold image? No. That's a terrible idea. Instead, flip a switch in Group Policy and get on with your life and go get a beer. It couldn't be simpler."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"How about getting out of the local admin rights business. You might think I am out of the local admin rights business, and that's great if you are. But if you aren't, that's obviously not good. You don't want to have users running with the scissors all the time. That's a terrible idea."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So then you remove local admin rights and you're in what I like to call the ditch. They still need local admin rights because some application won't run or they can't install their own printers or fonts or they can't install a key application like iTunes or UPS Quick Ship or something like that without wrapping it up as a package or something like that. That's terrible. You do not want to be involved in that transaction."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Sometimes, you want users to have opportunities to do things like an admin but not actually running with admin rights. So we're going to elevate certain applications and situations during our demo today."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Stopping ransomware and other unknown software, this is a great thing. I don't think we're going to have time for this today, so we have this on the website. The idea is that a user goes to a website, downloads a portable app, and they get bitcoined. Nobody wants to be the guy who has to explain to their boss what bitcoin is and how to buy it and so on. How do you block unknown software? Again, probably not something we'll get into today, but it's a humongous benefit for you."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"How do you map what I call the right browser and the right Java for the right website? I go to this website and it's flipping me out. Well, yeah, because not every browser renders every website perfectly.

Browser Router maps specific websites to specific browsers. Java Rules Manager will guarantee a particular version of Java to a particular website. File Associations Manager is where you can map specific extensions or protocols like PDF or MAILTO: to your applications like Acrobat or Outlook. I'll be showing you that today.

No problem, no problem, no problem. If you like the result of what you're going to see here today, if you want to, you can export any of these settings.

That works also."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So if you don't want to use Group Policy, you want to do the not-Group Policy method, that's fine.

You don't need any servers to build or buy or infrastructure or databases, for the love of Pete. Nobody wants another freaking database. No schema updates, no domain mode, no specific Windows Server needed and no specific Windows client needed. Most of what PolicyPak works with is Windows 7 and later.

You're going to install the PolicyPak client-side extension on your domain joined machines."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Client-side extension? Man, that sounds familiar. Yeah, because Microsoft already ships a bunch of those in the box. You already use them: admin templates, folder redirection, Group Policy Preferences shortcuts. You already use it. PolicyPak is architected the exact same way that Microsoft always wanted you to be able to extend what they're already doing, and we do that. When you run GP Update or run Group Policy results reports, we are Group Policy as if Microsoft themselves had shipped it from the factory. That's the important part."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The Cloud Edition, there's a little cloud agent that will then connect to our cloud service and let you download that stuff.

We don't want any of that."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What I'm going to do is show you how to wrestle this to the ground in two seconds here. We'll go to our \"Sales\" computers and we'll go to \"PPFAM Demo GPO.\" We'll create a Group Policy Object for file associations. Again, you might have seen how to do this in the box. You have to take your whole machine. You have to then export the settings and trim the XML.

You\'re fixed forever with the same ideas. Exactly right. Let\'s go ahead and not only do it once; we could also change our mind if we want to. Let\'s "Add" a "New Policy" first. This is easy. You just type "PDF" here, and I\'ll type "pdf" here. This is now saying on your machine, the machine I\'m on right now, what things say they can run PDFs? Well, on this machine I have "Adobe Reader." You might ask, why don\'t I see Edge on this list? Because this is a server machine, there is no Edge on this machine. There we go. I\'ve just associated PDF with Acrobat Reader.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'But what about an application like VLC media player that has 136 things? We have this special way to "Add Policies for Product (wizard)." I\'ll then say, yeah, pick any application you want on this machine or your friend\'s machine. So we\'ll pick "VLC media player" here. There are all the things VLC media player can do: .mp3, .mp4, .wav and so on. I\'ll select all these guys with one checkbox ("Check All"), click "Next. We\'ll make a little basket for you. There it is. In the little basket is all the freaking settings for that application just like that.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Webster:\xa0Yeah, iTunes is the same way."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Jeremy:\xa0iTunes is the same way, all that stuff. If you decide you want to "Add" a "New Policy" for things like "MAILTO rule," I\'ll go to "Network Protocol" and this can be "MAILTO." When I click on "Select Program," these are the things that claim they can do mail. I have "EUDORA," I have "Google Chrome," I have this thing and then I have "Claws-Mail." I\'m going to use "Claw-Mail" as my Outlook representative. I don\'t really have Outlook. I\'m going to use Claws Mail.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There we go. I've made my rules. I'm going to go to my endpoint here. I'm going to run GP Update (\"gpupdate\"). This particular setting is a little bit different than the others. You have to get the GPO first. Then you have to log off. Then you have to log on. Then the magic happens. That's the deal with this one. This isn't our physics. This is the physics that Microsoft provides in the box, and there's just not a lot we can do about it right now. Maybe in the future."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's take a look. Let's make sure I actually got the Group Policy first before I log off and log back on. Let's take a look. On the computer side, I got the file associations one (\"PPFAM Demo GPO\"). Okay, so I'm reasonably confident this is going to work the way I expect. Let me go ahead and \"Sign out\" here. Remember the icons. As soon as I sign back in here, don't take your eye off that locale."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That's it. You did it. You double click the PDF, you have the right Acrobat Reader, whatever it is. Or even better, if you have both Reader and Writer on the machine, you can make PolicyPak detect the thing you want and then make the final associations. So if you have Reader and Writer on the machine and you want the people who have Writer to have this and people to have Reader to, that's easy to do and we have a great video on how to do that."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"You want to click on this guy, and do you get VLC media player?

You have two methods and a couple things I want to show you here. I have a special treat for Citrix friends here because you know that this \"Citrix\" folder or thinking a look at the Citrix app in here is maybe not the best way to present stuff for your user.

I will run GP Update ("gpupdate") here, and we can watch this happen in real time. Watch this. Remember I pre-staged this to make this go a little faster just so we would have time.

Check this out. Now in here we said nuke everything and only show these two icons. Again, this is coming directly from the Citrix machine. So you're able to nuke the stuff Microsoft provides or anything the user might have done earlier, put your own groups in there, and put in real apps or Citrix apps."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Webster:\xa0Wait a minute.

In fairness, we have a script that will help you with that if you want to use our thing called PolicyPak Scripts to deliver that setting as well. But the point is that you're absolutely right. You shouldn't need to go through the motions and uninstall them. You can just make them not be present in their face. So they're there. They're underneath the hood. They're in this A-to-Z column stuff, but you can just get rid of it from the Start Menu and ostensibly achieve the exact same goal."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That's up to you. If you want to still go through the motions, we will let you achieve that. We have a component called PolicyPak Scripts and a script that will do that. But if you want to instead just hide those applications and leave them in this A-to-Z list, that's fine. Make a correct Start Menu based on the opportunities that people need, not whatever Microsoft wants versus what the user wants.
