What you do is you right click over the \u201cGroup Policy Objects\u201d node or over the actual Group Policy Object itself, and you can \u201cManage Backups\u2026\u201d or \u201cBack Up All\u2026\u201d"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What I\u2019ll go ahead and do is I\u2019ll \u201cBack Up All\u2026,\u201d and I\u2019ll browse for that new location that I have here.
