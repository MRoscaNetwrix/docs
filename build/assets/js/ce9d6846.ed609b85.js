In fact, if they have it clicked, that's a big problem. Because if they have it clicked and then the bad guys send them a PDF that has a problem or a virus in it, well then, it could be a big security hazard because that JavaScript is executing on this machine. I know that they've taken some strides around that, but it would be even safer if this thing were unchecked."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'But a user can just check it if they want to, or they click on "Security" and they uncheck "Verify signatures when the document is opened."

Let's right click over that guy, and we're going to totally \"Hide corresponding control in target application\" \u2013 literally remove it \u2013 so a user can't possibly screw it up.
