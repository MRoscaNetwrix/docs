We call this discovery mode."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The guy I\'m currently logged on as is EastSalesUser3, and he is a local admin. As a local admin, he can do all sorts of things.

Here are some quick examples. The first thing I'm going to do is run an application called \"TreeSize Free.\" It requires admin rights to get full effect. When you do this, what happens? It's going to run perfectly with local admin rights."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What we're going to show you is how to audit for that first. Let me show you in the \"Event Viewer.\" Right now, there won't be any events around this. I'm hitting F5, hitting Refresh. Nothing is happening here. Let me show you how to turn this on."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'You\'re going to use PolicyPak Least Privilege Manager. I\'ve got a Group Policy Object linked over to my "East Sales Users."

You would set it up for TreeSize Free and the publisher and make it as loose or as secure as you want.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'That is the first part of this. The next part of the story is let\'s pretend a user has now transitioned from a local admin to a standard user.

This is a second type of auditing that tells you what happens even when the person is a standard user."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let\'s go ahead and rerun this exercise here.

In fact, I'll do both. I'm going to go back and go to \"Switch user\" back to my \"EastSalesUser3\" who is an admin. EastSalesUser3, like I said, is an admin. The thing is that EastSalesUser3 might have some applications that he installed himself or dragged to the Desktop or otherwise got and is using day-to-day, but they don't require admin rights."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Here's one. Here's \"CamPlay.\" I don't know what the heck CamPlay is. Oh, it's just a video player. That's fine.

You should know what applications are going to be prevented when you turn on PolicyPak SecureRun."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As a reminder, PolicyPak SecureRun's job is to put the smackdown on applications for when they're not installed correctly by an admin. In this case, this file is owned by the guy EastSalesUser3. If I were to go to \"Security/Advanced\" here, you can see he is the \"Owner.\" That's probably weird. This is indicating that this guy went out to the Internet, downloaded CamPlay. He's the owner, and you probably want to be aware of what happens when you turn on SecureRun and remove admin rights from this guy."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Here's a standard app. You can see I just ran it. We're not going to see anything interesting in the event logs because of that. Nothing happened here. Let's go back over to our \"Global Settings\" policy. Again, this is also called discovery.

What we're also going to do here is flag any file that's owned by this guy."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let\'s go ahead and take a look. Now if we go to CamPlay here and run it, now what do we get? Let\'s refresh here. Bingo. "Process" \u2013 CamPlay \u2013 "is untrusted and would have been blocked by SecureRun." Because if we take a look at the SecureRun list here if we look at the "SecureRun Policy," the defaults in SecureRun are the local "Administrator," "SYSTEM," and "TrustedInstaller." So the idea is when this guy transitions from local admin to standard user, he\'s not going to be a local admin anymore. So we\'re showing and enumerating that this would be a problem for this guy.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'We can also see this exact same event if we were to go to the guy who is already a standard user.
