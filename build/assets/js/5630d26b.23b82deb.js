In this video we are going to talk about the ability to create custom messages when you choose to deny a particular application. This works with UWP applications when you deny those or when you deny specific desktop applications. You can do that. Right now as of the recording of this video, this does not apply to things that are blocked with secure run. It only refers to things that you specifically choose to block."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Right now I have created a GPO where we deny UWP applications.
