Administrators can still request (pull) data directly from endpoints, like in pull mode, but they can also take advantage of the server with clientless auditing, through which endpoints deliver their data directly to a central server. This enables all endpoints the ability to push their data up whenever Group Policy applies or changes on an endpoint. In this way, endpoints are not required to be on at the time administrators want to query their status.
