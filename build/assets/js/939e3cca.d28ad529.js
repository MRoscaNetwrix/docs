I\'m going to say this version of Procmon, I want to let it "Run with elevated privileges" but only when I use "Item Level Targeting" that says I\'m a specific user or a group.

I\'m logged on as a different user. I actually have the same Procmon in a folder called "DEMOS1." Let me show you what happens if you click on "Procmon." Procmon only works as eastsalesuser1.
