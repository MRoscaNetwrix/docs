I can see that for "WIN7COMPUTER-32" a guy called "EastSalesUser1" has logged on there.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Next, if you double click on a line item, you\'ll get everything that happened on the "Computer" side and you get everything that happened on the "User" side as well, so basically the same thing that you would get in the Group Policy results reporter in the GPMC. The good news, however, is that like I said you can quickly get the Group Policy results for all of the computers that you interrogate.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But here's the thing. Even though I love having the Group Policy results reports at my fingertips this easily, you still would have to manually dig down and see: is that setting true, is this setting true, is that still there?

I\'ll go ahead and click on that and click "Generate Results" and let\'s see what happens.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Well, none of my users are compliant with this. If I take a look at this combination, "EastSalesUser1 on WIN7COMPUTER-32" is "Missing" that particular setting. Let\'s see if that\'s actually true. If we go to "Personalize" on this computer and go to "Screen Saver," sure enough. He doesn\'t have this checkmark checked, which would make him more secure.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'What we\'ll do next is we\'ll fix that problem. That would be you using the GPMC to edit a Group Policy Object and ensure that the "Screen Saver Password Lock" was in fact "Enabled." Go over to your target machines. You could either wait for Group Policy to apply or you can run GP Update. I\'m doing that to make this demo go just a little bit faster.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Now that this is done, you would have to right click and go to 5,000 machines and see: is that true on that machine? Instead, you\'re going to use the "Group Policy Compliance Reporter" to take another "Snapshot." Right click, "Create snapshot" here, which will interrogate all the computers that are currently online and figure out what\'s happening right now.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'If we go over to the "Results" and we pick the now latest "Snapshot" and click "OK" and "Generate Results," we\'ll now see "WIN7COMPUTER-32" is totally fine. He has all the tests pass. That\'s fantastic, but we still have a problem with this guy. The only reason we\'re having a problem with this guy is that he hasn\'t gotten the latest, greatest Group Policy yet.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That is Group Policy Compliance Reporter Standalone Edition.
