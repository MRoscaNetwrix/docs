In this video I'm going to show you how you can overcome the print nightmare nightmare.

Here's an Epson, a driver I've never seen before that's never been installed on this computer."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It says do you want to install the driver? If you say yes, the problem with print nightmare is that it stops stuff working in their tracks. Here's what happens. You go all the way over here.
