I built this package in PDQ deploy. We don't offer WinZip because it's a paid application in the package library. So, I just extracted the MSI.

It's a miracle. I love it. Okay. So, now the problem, of course, is now that it's deployed with magic how are you going to manage the heck out of it? So, by way of example if you take WinZip or applications like WinZip and you run it the first time, well, first you have this to contend with. I'm sure you have a way around that. I'm going to just use evaluation version for now, but for me I think what's important is managing things that would make an application more secure or prevent popups like that and things like that.

So, we're going to deliver all four of these checkboxes, lock some things down and make it so users can't work around that. Now, in our last video we staged our PolicyPak admin console such that if we go to our deadwood users \u2013 no our deadwood users. That's where they live. Right click here. Go over here. Right click. New GPO and we'll call this \"Manage WinZip using PolicyPak.\" Right click. Click edit on the GPO. And we've already pre-staged the paks in the management console so we're ready to go. User side, PolicyPak \u2013 the node that we're after is application settings manager. You'll find all the applications that we pre-staged here."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Right click new application. There we go. We manage all sorts of things. Today we're going to do WinZip. And we'll just double-click on that guy and my favorite part is that it looks just like WinZip right in the management console. So, we'll go right over to, say, passwords. Check all four checkboxes here. Jack the minimum password length, say, to eleven and while we're here you can actually right click and disable the corresponding control in the target application making it so users really can't work around these settings. We also have some advanced things like perform ACL lockdown so a naughty, super smart user can't even work around it if they know where the thing lives in the registry or the file system."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"So, we'll go ahead and do that as well. We'll also \u2013 I don't know. I'll go ahead and disable this corresponding control just to show you something else and for cameras I'm going to right click the entirety of cameras and disable the whole tab in the target application. Like, rip the knob off of the entirety of cameras. And that's it. Let's go over to our endpoint machine. We could remotely run, say, GP update if we wanted to, but I'm just going to right click and run GP update. Trixie. Trixie and just run GP update here.
