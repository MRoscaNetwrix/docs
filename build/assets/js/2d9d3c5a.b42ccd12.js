With Least Privilege Manager and all of Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)\'s components we have this idea of item-level targeting.

This rule will not run anymore on Windows 7.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'When you do that, you can see it turns to orange and you can also look over here and "Item Level Targeting" is changed to "Yes."
