The one video, we talked about if you've got your ThinApp applications embedded in your image or on physical machines. In the second video about ThinApp, we talked about how it works perfectly if you're using VMWare View to assign those applications. In this video, we're demonstrating how if you're using VMWare Horizon Workspace \u2013 particularly the applications part of it where you can sling VMWare ThinApps to your members \u2013 then we also work perfectly there as well."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.p,{children:"Let's go ahead and get started. Let's take a look at my configuration. We'll start over here, I guess. We're using the \"VMWare Horizon Configurator\" here. We've got \"ThinApp Packages,\" and those ThinApp packages have been allocated accordingly and uploaded to the VMWare Horizon Workspace server. Then they are entitled to the particular users that we want. That's all done. The next thing you can see here is what it looks like to the user.

You can see one of them is right here. We said that we wanted to "Manage Acrobat XI (Real and ThinApp)." Let\'s review how we did that. All we did was we went to the user side "PolicyPak/Applications/New/Application" and picked the application off the list. PolicyPak ships with over 100 preconfigured Paks, and you can create your own if you want to.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.p,{children:'Then we configured Acrobat Reader.

Again, we did this in the last video.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.p,{children:"The result actually is exactly the same. Let me say that again. I'm not changing anything from the last video to this video.
