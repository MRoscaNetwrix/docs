We're going to keep it simple in this video and we're going to just simply delete everything in the Temp folder. Of course that command is going to be del C:/temp/q. I like to pre-test things before I put them into scripts. There you go and if you take a look at Temp, look at that, nothing in Temp. Let me copy a bunch of junk back here into Temp so I have something to actually delete later. Here we go, so I've copied a bunch of stuff back into Temp."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Again, the point is the script that we have just verified as del C:/temp/q \u2013 here's all my stuff now. Let's go ahead and go to PolicyPak Scripts and Triggers. I'm going to do this for all of my computer in sales, so \"Clean up Temp at computer shutdown time\" with PolicyPak's Scripts and Triggers. Go ahead and click Edit here and this one, we're going to do on the computer side. We'll do computer side PolicyPak Scripts Manager and then we will right-click, Add a New Policy here. This one we're going to do for the computer. This is the computer doing the work, not the user doing the work. What we're doing to do here is say \"run a batch script.\" It can be PowerShell or whatnot. We're just going to run a batch script, del C:/temp/q, and that's it. There is no revert action on trigger-based scripts. Then the trigger that we want is going to be on shutdown."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go ahead and try this on for size.

Alright, now that we're done \u2013 so one last time here that I have a bunch of junk in Temp\xa0 and now, let's restart the computer, which is of course a shutdown and I'll come back at log-on time and we'll see what happens in the Temp folder. We're ready to log on here. Go ahead and do that, give this a second to log on. Now that we're logged on, let's see if the actual activity worked.
