If I were to go to a West Sales User, go to "Switch user" to "WestSalesUser1," it\'s not available for the group West Sales Users.

It\'s not a thing that West Sales Users can see at all.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'That\'s the first part of the equation.Let me go ahead and "Sign out" here. Then let\'s go ahead and log back in as "EastSalesUser1." I just want to set the stage of where we\'re at.

We can use PolicyPak to the rescue.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'For our "Sales" team we can say it doesn\'t matter where this application is hidden or not hidden because of FSLogix. We can say "Elevate TSF with PP." We\'ll right click, click "Edit" on this GPO here, and we\'ll dive down under user side, "PolicyPak/Least Privilege Manager." We\'ll then right click, "Add/New Executable Policy." We can do this for all sorts of things like "Windows Installer" and "Script" and "Java (JAR)," all sorts of things.

That user would be "EastSalesUser1," not "EastSalesUser2" or 3 or 4 or whatever, just one guy. This guy can run TreeSize Free as admin but nobody else. There we go.
