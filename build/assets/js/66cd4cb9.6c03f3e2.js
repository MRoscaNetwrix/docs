If you're watching this video, it probably means that we asked you to try to figure out where some slowdown is happening."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"We have some generalized guidance, and then this next step is going to help us narrow it down even further.

MDM, you're just going to export this and get it over to some example target machine. If I wanted to use PP ADMX to target slowdowns or something like that, what we'll do is we'll right-click, go to click Edit here. You have to have the PolicyPak ADMX settings already in place. We have another video for that, so I'm not going to spend time on that."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Under Policies, Admin Templates, under the PolicyPak ADMX Settings, under Client Side Extensions, what we're going to need you to do here to try to figure out why things are slowing down is to actually actively turn off each component one-by-one.

Very similarly, in PolicyPak Cloud land, again, we recommend you have a small scale test group. Here, what you would do is move a couple of computers in. You would create and link a new policy here under Admin Templates."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"We already have the PolicyPak Admin template, so if you wanted to prevent item from running, whatever it is.

We realize and recognize this could be a little bit of work on your side to do. It's an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure. In other words, it will be a lot faster for everybody if we can just get down and figure out exactly which component it is that's causing the problems."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"ope this video helps you out.
