If we don't have an in-cloud editor for things, and there are some things that we'll never have in-cloud editors for, that is why in the other section we talk about in excruciating detail why you need that on-prem test lab, that fake on-prem test lab for you to be able to create directives. Sometimes even if we have an in-cloud editor, there's some advanced stuff that you can only do in the on-prem editor and then take the directive, right-click, View as XML in Notepad for a particular policy or on a collection. You can View as XML in Notepad or you can do it at the root level too sometimes."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"The point is that sometimes you need to do the on-prem test lab first between your machine and your domain controller and your domain-joined machine.
