Do you want to open this file? You've already associated it correctly. You can see that it's correctly going to use Acrobat Reader, but why does Windows still ask? Well, there's an easy way to make this problem go away. This isn't a file association manager problem; this is just Windows trying to advertise its own stuff, so let's go ahead and show you how you can work around this."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"I've got a GPO where I like to put things that want to affect all users here, so I'm going to put it into my General Needs GPO here. What you're going for here is the \u2013 under the Policies Admin Templates, you're looking for Windows Components File Explorer Then you're looking for Do Not Show the New Application Installed Notifications. Let's set that to enabled. Okay, so now that we've done this guy here, we'll do a quick AB test. You saw me do that before, so now I'm going to run GP Update, and you may need to log off and log back on. This'll affect the next time the guy logs on and every user going forward in the future, so let's go ahead and do that here."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Alright, so I'll go ahead and run GP Update here.

Sign back in, and now let's go ahead and run it and see what happens. Look at that, no more questions. If we were to log off here and log on as, say, West Sales User 3 \u2013 let's go ahead and do that. Sign out here. We'll sign on as a user that's never even logged on before.
