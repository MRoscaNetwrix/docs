In this demonstration, you\'re going to see me deliver applications icons to the Taskbar, and they can be applications that live inside your groups or ones that are just strewn here across the whole universe.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.p,{children:'How are we going to do this? We\'re going to go over to our "GPMC," and you can do this either on the computer side or the user side. I\'m going to do this on the user side. I already have a GPO that I created previously.

I\'m going to "Add/New Collection," and I\'ll just call this "Coll 1." It doesn\'t really matter what it\'s called. The point here is that there are two choices: "Merge" or "Replace." "Merge" says keep what the user already has and just add your two or whatever icons on top of it. "Replace" says get rid of all these icons here on the Taskbar and put your own. I\'m going to show you "Merge" first and "Replace" second.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.p,{children:'We\'ll start off with "Merge" and we\'ll go ahead and click "OK" here. Inside the "Taskbar Manager," we\'re going to "Add" either a "New Desktop Application" or a "New Universal Application." I\'ll go ahead and pick a "New Desktop Application." I\'ll go ahead and start with good old "Adobe Reader." I happen to have it installed on this machine, so it makes it a little easier.

So we have these two icons here. I\'ll go ahead and run a "Command Prompt" and run GP Update ("gpupdate"). Here\'s the thing. This won\'t take effect until the guy logs off and logs back on. So actually, GP Update really doesn\'t matter in this case. I could have just logged off and logged back on, but I\'ll show you what it looks like. Taskbar stuff doesn\'t happen until you log off and log back on, so let\'s go ahead and do that. I\'ll "Sign out" and then I\'ll sign back on.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.p,{children:'Now remember, we said Merge mode. So it should leave in place the application icons we already have there.

We\'ll "Edit Collection" and change the method to "Replace" mode.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(a.p,{children:"Like I said, stuff doesn't happen in Taskbar land until you log off and log back on, so let's go ahead and show that.
