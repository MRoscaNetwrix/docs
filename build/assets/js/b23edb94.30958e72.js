Over here on my server, actually I\'ve got a share called "share," and I have a cert called "CERT1.cer." I want to get that cert delivered to my client machines.

The idea is that you simply specify where the cert is. By way of example, I just showed you it\'s on my "\\dc" in a share called "share" and it\'s called "cert1.cer."

It can be local or over the network, provided they can get to it over the network. Then you declare it based on the thumbprint. Now if you don\'t know where the thumbprint is of a certificate, let me just show you how you would. Here in "Internet Options" if you were to go to "Certificates" and look at any given certificate here \u2013 I\'m just picking this one at random \u2013 if you look at the "Details," you\'ll see that there\'s a thumbprint.
