This is Jeremy Moskowitz. In previous videos, we used Group Policy to deliver settings to our machines that would say when I use this website, use this version of Java. Now, we used Group Policy to do that, but you don't have to. If you want to, you can use SCCM, Altiris, LANDesk, Intune, KACE or whatever management system you have. In previous videos, I was using Group Policy. In these videos, I'm going to be using what I call the \"not Group Policy\" method. It's very simple to do."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'For instance, in a previous video, I said when I\'m on Windows 10, I want to use Java 8 U 25 and when I\'m on Windows 7, I want to use Java 7 U 51. Okay, so what you can do is simply right click over each of these policy settings and select "Export as XML." I\'m going to save it right to the "Desktop," and I\'ll call this "Java-on-10." Then I will right click this guy here and "Export as XML" and say "Java-on-7."'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Now we provide a little utility called the "PolicyPak Exporter Tool." I\'ll go ahead and run that and show you how quickly this works. You\'ve probably seen this maybe in other videos, the "PolicyPak Exporter Tool." What it does is it will take directives from any PolicyPak product and let you wrap it up into a friendly MSI file.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'I\'m going to "Add Existing Files," in fact, the existing files I just exported ten seconds ago, one for Windows 7 and one for Windows 10.

I\'m going to save it in a share that I\'ve got on this server. It\'s on a share called "share." I\'ll call this "PP-Java-Rules-MSI." That\'s it. So it just has a simple name.

I'm going to simply run that MSI manually."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now this MSI will run completely silently, but for the purposes of this if I do \"net use * \\dc2016share\" and I run the \"msi,\" it's going to prompt me for install.

But now if we go to the website we said which was "java.com," we\'ve mapped java.com to a different version of Java. So "Do I have Java?" here, now we\'ll see that with not using Group Policy, using your deployment tool, we are now using "Version 8 Update 25" for this website for Windows 10.
