OK, well, first thing is that you can see here what you want to do is if you want to set this you need to note the type. See how the type here is "boolean."

That\'s really important because that\'s how you\'re going to configure this in the Design Studio.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'What we\'re going to do is go over to the "Design Studio" first. We\'ll then go ahead and just make it nice and pretty. What I like to do is take a "Label" here, and we\'ll just drag a "Label" down. I\'ll name this thing "browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser," and this is just the display name. This has nothing to do with the actual configuration.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Next thing we want to do is this is a true/false, so what I would suggest that you do here is you put a little "Check Box" in.

We\'ll go ahead and we\'ll call this \u2013 again this is the official thing we\'re doing here \u2013 which is "browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser."
