This video is going to show you exactly how you would fix that if you were a PolicyPak customer."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'With that in mind, let\'s make sure I actually have Java running. What I\'m going to do is go to the "Control Panel" on this example machine and go to "java" here. Let\'s go ahead and go to the "Java" tab and click "View\u2026." You\'ll see here I\'ve actually gone the extra mile. I\'ve actually got Java "1.6" and "1.7" installed, and you can see that right here. What happens if you\'ve got two versions of Java installed? What are you going to do then? Let\'s correct all these problems all in one shot by delivering the setting that will un-"Enable" Java here.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's really make sure it's really working and I'm not pulling a fast one on you.

Here's \"java test.\" \"How do I test whether Java is working on my computer?\" This is the kind of prompt a user would get. They would click run, and sure enough, Java is working."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go to \"Firefox,\" and we will also do \"java test.\" Let's see. Is it working here? Yes.

Let's go over to our management station. Here on my management station, I've got all my \"PreConfigured PolicyPaks.\" PolicyPak ships with over 50 preconfigured Paks for popular applications like Flash, Firefox, Acrobat Reader, FileZilla, Office, Lync \u2013 all sorts of applications that if a vulnerability occurs and a manufacturer makes a suggestion for what to flip on or off, you can deliver and enforce and remediate that setting using PolicyPak."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'I\'ve already gone through the motions and copied in the right file to the right place here.

Under computer side "PolicyPak/Applications/New/Application," here are just some of the Paks that I\'ve slid in in advance. I\'ve got "Adobe Reader," "Flash," "Chrome," "Firefox" and here\'s "Java."

I'm just doing those extra settings for fun."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'All we\'re going to do next is wait for Group Policy to update. We\'ll use "gpupdate" in order to do that here. Now that we\'re done, let\'s first go over to "java" here and let\'s see what occurred. Let\'s go over to "Advanced," and you can see here those settings that I specifically set to "Never allow" and "Do not start console," plus I locked down those features so users can\'t work around it.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let\'s also go over to the "Java" tab and go to "View\u2026," and you can see here that both of those checkmarks are now disabled.
