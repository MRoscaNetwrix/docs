Now let's figure out how to take our Group Policy directives that we already have and export them to something we can utilize within Microsoft Intune. What we're going to do next is pretty simple.

Let's go ahead and let's just take a look at our applications really fast. We'll go take a look. See, \"Adobe Reader X\" is not configured.

They can just work around your "Security" settings. That\'s not good.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Again, this is because so far the user doesn't yet have the directives that we've locked and loaded inside Microsoft Intune, so none of your configuration settings are there.
