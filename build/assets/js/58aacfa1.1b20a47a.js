So if we click \"Edit\u2026\" inside that Group Policy Object, well, first things first because we don't even have the PolicyPak node. So we need to get the PolicyPak node on this new machine. How do we do that? Very simply. We have our own add-on to the GPMC, our own snap-in. You're just going to double click on the \"PolicyPak Admin Console\" link here. This only takes a second to install here, so we'll click that we're going to install it here."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'When it\'s done, we\'ll click "Close."
