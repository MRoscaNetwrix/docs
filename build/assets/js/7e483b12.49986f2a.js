In this video we\u2019re going to walk before we run with our MDM service and PolicyPak. You do need to be a little bit prepared for this. In this example I\u2019ve got my machine, and it is enrolled into an MDM like InTune. It could be something else like Citrix CEM or VMware Workspace. That\u2019s all fine. In this case, I\u2019m enrolled into InTune land. That\u2019s the first piece you need to have done."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Second thing is you need to be prepared with three other things.
