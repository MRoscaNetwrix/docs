In this video I'm going to show you how to apply custom default application file associations using Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager. If you're missing any applications needed for your custom file associations, you'll need to install those before continuing. If the necessary applications are already installed, then it's time to set up your custom file associations."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now that our custom file associations are set, the next step is to use PowerShell running as administrator to export our custom file associations to the XML file.

With that done, we're going to head over to our computer running the Group Policy management console and create the Scripts Manager policy, which will distribute this policy to our users."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We're going to create this policy on the user side since we want it to apply to our users and not the computer.
