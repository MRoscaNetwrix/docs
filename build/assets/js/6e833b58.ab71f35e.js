The reason you want to promote your server to a DC is so that you can leverage the "GPCM" here, as you can see that I have, and create the directives that will then be exported as XML and uploaded to PolicyPak Cloud.

My domain is called \"whitneyr.com.\" You want to have a domain joined machine because that will let you take out the middle man, so to speak. You can create your directives on your server and then push them over to your domain joined machine, make sure the directive works, then you can upload it to the cloud. That way, you cut out the cloud service as the middle man so if anything goes wrong, you can troubleshoot whether it's the directive itself or if there's something going on with the cloud."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"So you need those three parts.
