I'm just using my kind of garden variety, you know, offline test lab here. So, go ahead and edit the GPO and you're going to create a group policy preference for this item, so that's going to live under Computer Side, Preferences, and then you're going to go to Local Users and Groups. You're going to create a new local user here and you can give this guy a name such as Fred and give him a password."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Now, you may need to downgrade your GPMC to a version that enables you to put a password field in here if you want this person to get a password because new versions of the GPMC will NOT permit this because if this GPO is stored actually in active directory, this password could be revealed but for the purposes of what we're trying to do, this is actually reasonably safe. So, we'll go ahead and save this password \u2013 we'll save this out here and now let's just see what we've done. We've created a new local user and that's all there is to it. The next step would be to go to the PolicyPak node here and you're going to use the PolicyPak export utility here that exists under Preferences Manager. You will simply at this point run the export wizard, which will then let you find the item here. There's Fred and we've got no targeting on it, so we'll just go ahead and say next."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"We'll pick the place where we're going to go. I'm going to pick it to a folder called Exported. We'll have some other stuff there and click next and that's all there is to it. So, now in PolicyPak Cloud land, let's go ahead and log on. Then we'll go to Computer Groups and we'll do this for all computers if that's what we want to do or you can them for specific computers. I'm going to upload and link a new XML file here. I'll go ahead and pick my desktop exported folder and pick the Fred item type. Okay, so I'll call this Add Fred to Local Computers. I'll go ahead and click Add here and there we go, so now Fred is added to that built-in group. You could do it to a company group as well. I'll go over to my Cloud machine. He's already joined PolicyPak Cloud in this scenario."}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(o.p,{children:["Let me prove to you that I'm not pulling a fast one on you here.

Okay, and that's all there is to it. That's a way for you to create a local user and set a password.
