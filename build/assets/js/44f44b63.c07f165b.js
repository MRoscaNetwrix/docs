First things first, no EULA because PolicyPak delivered the setting to say, "Thanks, but no thanks," to the EULA. So right out of the gate, even if you might have forgotten to do that inside your ThinApp package, the best part is we\'re dynamically delivering the settings on the fly right at logon time.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'If we go to "Edit/Preferences\u2026" here, let\'s make sure that some of the other settings that we set earlier are in effect.

I want to launch each version of Firefox and show you what\'s actually happening. Like I said, this one ("Mozilla Firefox") is prebaked in, and this is a really old version of Firefox.

The idea is that if a user goes to an application and they want to make a settings change themselves, for instance, in this example I\'ll go to "Edit/Preferences\u2026" here, and perhaps this user wants to change the "Units" from "Inches" to "Centimeters."'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"OK, great, so they've changed that.

As soon as I do, I'll pick another machine to log onto here in the virtual pool here. I'll log on as the same user. I'll get a different machine in the pool, and PolicyPak will be delivering the IT administrator's desired settings. VMWare View Persona Management will be preserving the user's requested preference style settings."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In this way, we have a fantastic better together story.

I think ThinApps are still installing. Some of them are streaming. Let\'s go ahead and just run "Adobe Reader XI (Thinapp)." There we go. There was "Mozilla Firefox21 (ThinApp)" popping in.

I\'m going to go back over to "Manage Acrobat XI (Real and ThinApp)" using PolicyPak, and I will dictate the exact same setting here.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'What I\'ll do is I\'ll go into "Adobe Reader XI," go over to "Units" and I\'m going to change this to something. Maybe our corporate standard it "Millimeters" and we want to right click and also "Disable corresponding control in target application" so users can\'t work around it. We\'ll go ahead. We\'ll click "OK" here.'}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:'We\'ll go back to our example machine. Now, the user could simply log off and log back on and get a new machine, or they could wait for Group Policy to kick in in the background, which is every 90 minutes or so.

We\'ll go ahead and run "Adobe Reader XI (Thinapp)" and go to "Edit/Preferences\u2026" here. There it is.
