If your applications are insecure, then your network is insecure."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go over some examples. By way of example, let's go ahead and run \"Adobe Reader X\" here.

The idea is that if this is checked, which it is by default, you want to uncheck it.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Same idea here with "Security (Enhanced)."
