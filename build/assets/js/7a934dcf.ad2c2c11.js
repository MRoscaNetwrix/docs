I\'ve already got my cert ready to go on my server here. It\'s in a share called "SHARE" and it\'s in a folder called "Certs." It has a great name called "RootCERT."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let me go ahead and "Create a GPO in this domain, and link it here" and call it "Manage Firefox Cert using PolicyPak." Right click and click "Edit" here. You can do this for either the "User" or the "Computer" side. I\'m going to do it on the "Computer" side, and therefore it will affect everybody on this computer. "PolicyPak/Applications/New/Application" and pick "PolicyPak for Mozilla Firefox 23.0." It has an unusual name.

It can either be local, or as you can see here it could be on a share somewhere. You give it the store name, and the store names are documented in our documentation."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Then you give it a number if you want to check every X number of days. If you only want to validate that the cert hasn\'t been updated in two days, you can do that. Or you can do nothing at all, and it will simply just check every time. And the word "add" or "remove."

There we go. Let\'s go ahead and close that out. We\'ll go ahead and run "Mozilla Firefox" here, and let\'s take a look at "Options/Certificates/View Certificates."
