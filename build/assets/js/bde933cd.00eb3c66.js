They don't consistently redeliver settings, and they don't perform UI lockout. We learned how a utility like PolicyPak can actually deliver those settings and actually perform UI lockout. In this video, let's take it to the next level. Let's understand the idea of delivering and un-delivering settings."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let me "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here\u2026" called "Control Panel Smackdown." Here\'s Control Panel Smackdown. It\'s linked over to my "East Sales Users." I\'ll click "Edit" here and under "User Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Control Panel," I\'m going to "Prohibit access to the Control Panel." I\'ll select "Enabled" for that guy and click "OK." You can see that setting is now "Enabled."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Here's my \"WinZip ADM\" file.

We're going to verify that two things have taken place. Thing number one is we said no Control Panel. Let's right click and go to \"Personalize,\" and that is the Control Panel. You can see that the Control Panel has been restricted on this computer because this application \u2013 which is Windows Explorer \u2013 he knows what to do when he gets the signal of no Control Panel set to one. By the way, that's a real bug inside of Windows 7. This is nothing special."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go over to \"WinZip.\" Again, since this guy has never logged on before, we will in fact see that those settings will have been delivered using the ADM file. As we saw in the last video, if the user unchecks the checkboxes \u2013 I'll just unselect two of them for fun, the top two, and click \"OK\" \u2013 there's nothing preventing the user from doing that, and there's nothing in the box that will reinstate those settings."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We learned in the last video, again, if you log off and log back on or run GPUpdate, it doesn't actually solve your problem. It doesn't actually redeliver those settings. Again, this was all covered in the last video. I'm kind of beating a dead horse here. I'm sorry about that, but you can see Group Policy is not redelivering those settings from those ADM or ADMX files."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The other half of the equation, and that's what we want to talk about here in this video, is what happens when settings no longer apply.

The technical term for what I\'m doing is called making these GPOs fall out of scope of management. Now there are a lot of ways a GPO could fall out of scope of management. You could delete the GPO. You could move the guy from sales to marketing. You could unlink it like I did here, but you can see that I have unlinked "Control Panel Smackdown" and "Use WinZip ADM."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now I know your expectation. Your expectation is when the guy logs on the next time after Group Policy applies or Group Policy updates in the background, well then, those restrictions should be lifted and things should revert back. Unfortunately, it's only half true."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let\'s show the Control Panel. If I go to right click and go to "Personalize," does this work? You bet.

In fact, you've heard this phrase before. You've heard the phrase registry tattooing. You've heard that phrase before.

This is where PolicyPak comes in. PolicyPak has both a free community mode and a commercial application. Let me go ahead, and we\'ll reutilize the "Lockdown WinZip using PolicyPak" edict here. Let\'s dive down under "PolicyPak/Applications/New/Application."'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'As you saw me do in the last video, PolicyPak ships with over 50 pre-configured, important Paks or applications that you have that are both registry and non-registry based. But for the purposes of this talk, we\'ll continue to "PolicyPak for WinZip 14 and Later" here.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let\'s go over to "Passwords" guy over here. PolicyPak is delivering all four of these checkboxes. It\'s also going to "Hide corresponding control in target application" and also "Disable corresponding control in target application."

Remember, the default value is 8. I'm going to make this setting also while I'm here \u2013 check this out \u2013\"Revert the policy setting to the default value when it is no longer applied.\" Very critical. For that setting, I'll make it revert when it is no longer applied, and I'll also do it for all of them \u2013 revert when they are no longer applied."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Because that's what we're driving at here. You don't want these settings to tattoo on the target machine. If you delivered it, that's great. If the Group Policy Object no longer applies because the guy changed job roles, then it should revert back, and that is the PolicyPak superpower we want to talk about here."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go ahead and run \"gpupdate\" here. We'll get the settings delivered using PolicyPak. We'll do the UI lockdown that only PolicyPak can do.

We can see PolicyPak has, in fact, delivered all the settings just the way we want to.

You can see it\'s set to "11," three checkboxes are checked and one is hidden. When I used ADM files, what happened? When I used ADM files, what happened was that those settings just simply tattooed on my target machine. Not good.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Instead with PolicyPak, I'm right clicking over the GPO and unlinking it, or the guy is changing job roles or whatever. We'll run \"gpupdate\" to simulate what happens here, or we could log off and log back on \u2013 same idea. When we do, now what is your expectation? Should things tattoo the registry and stick around and be there for the end of time confusing the user?"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'When we run "WinZip," go to "Options/Configuration\u2026," go to "Passwords,"PolicyPak has unchecked all four of those checkboxes and reverted the password length that was 11 directly down to "8."

It\'s exactly what your expectation is.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If you have people changing job roles or you're creating and deleting Group Policy Objects, only PolicyPak will actually revert the setting instead of tattooing it or leaving it behind the way, unfortunately, ADM and ADMX files do."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I hope this was helpful for you.
