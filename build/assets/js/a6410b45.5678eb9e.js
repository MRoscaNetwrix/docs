They want to manage the bookmarks in Firefox. But we'll just go right for things that we can just touch really quick. But we can do just about do nearly everything. So, if we go to the homepage here. We'll go to PolicyPak.com and we'll right click on this thing and we will lock down this setting using the system wide config file.

There's a billion things you could do here to really manage the heck out of Firefox, but we're done. That's it. Let's go over to our management station. We'll go ahead and run GP update here. Okay.

Let's go ahead and take a look. We'll just go right back over to Firefox. Go back over to the hamburger menu, also called the Australias. And there we go. There's the homepage, all locked down. Beautiful. And if we go to security, all locked down. You just can't' work around it. You want to remove sync? You want to do certificates?
