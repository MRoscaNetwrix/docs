I already have a GPO linked over to "Sales" and I have a GPO ready to go here. I want to pick "PolicyPak for Mozilla Firefox 23.0." PolicyPak has over 500 preconfigured apps. I just happen to be using the Firefox Pak for this. This is really "23.0" and later.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:'If I go over to "Extras," I\'m going to go right over to "Google" just like that. While I\'m also here, I\'ll go to "About: Preferences" and "Hide Search preferences" tab. That does two things at once. We\'re driving Google as the default, and we\'re also going to remove the UI so that users can\'t be naughty and work around your desired configuration later.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:'Now that that\'s done, let\'s relaunch "Mozilla Firefox" and here we go. The very next time we run Firefox and type in "policypak," you get "Google" to show up. If we were to go as the standard user and go to "Options," there is no more Search dialogue box. We\'ve made it very difficult for them to be naughty.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"That's it. You might also think, \"What if a user goes over here and clicks on the \u2018Change Search Settings'?\" Well, they can't. You've nuked it off the map using PolicyPak. If they want to temporarily change the search engine during their session, they're welcome to do so. But the next time PolicyPak runs, which again is going to be as soon as the application reruns, we're going to drive that setting back in. So that's only a temporary value for during that session, and you are guaranteeing that the next time it runs \"Google\" or whatever yours of choice is going to be delivered."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"I hope this helps you out.
