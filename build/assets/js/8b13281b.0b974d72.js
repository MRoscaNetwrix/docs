What we're going to do instead is use \"PolicyPak Least Privilege Manager.\" Actually, we provide some preconfigured knowledge to help you out in this case. Let me go ahead and get my Group Policy editor here. We've got the preconfigured knowledge over here. We have a bunch of situations that you might already be in. You could make it yourself.

Let's actually see what's happening underneath the hood in case your curious. What we're doing is we're saying if the name is \"iTunes\" or \"SetupAdmin\" (which is happening actually within iTunes) and only if it's signed by \"Apple,\" then it's good to be elevated. Okay, so let's check it out. Let's go back over to our endpoint here. We'll go ahead and run GP Update.
