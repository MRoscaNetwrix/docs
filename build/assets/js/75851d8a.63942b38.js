Let\'s go ahead and check it out. Let\'s start off with "Composition," and let\'s go over to "Spelling."

That\'s great, but if it\'s not set, how do you set it en masse?'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:'Let\'s go over to "Security" and "Anti-Virus."

You probably want to "Always check to see if Thunderbird is the default mail client on startup." If a user unchecks that and clicks "OK,"what does that mean?
