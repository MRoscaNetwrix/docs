I'll just hop over to the user side here, go to Application Settings Manager, and let's go for Firefox; that's our example for today. I'm going to open this up, and I'll just check a couple of things. Let's say Show a Blank Page and Always Ask Me Where to Save the Files. Okay, we've made a couple of changes. Alright, so if we look right here, we are going to see that this extension version is from 2016. That's a little on the old side, so imagine something doesn't work, or imagine you just need to upgrade your pack for whatever reason. The manual way to do that is to go to the website and log into the customer portal.

Now it doesn't normally say that, so what happens now is when I go to try to edit this policy, I'll double-click, and this just says, \"This PolicyPak was created by an obsolete DLL and will be upgraded using a current DLL,\" and you say okay, thank you very much."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Then you can make any changes, do whatever you need to do, and then tell it OK.
