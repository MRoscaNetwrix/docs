This is Jeremy Moskowitz. In previous videos, you saw me associate things like PDF to Acrobat Reader, but it turns out there's actually more than meets the eye there. In fact, there are a bunch of things that Acrobat Reader needs in order to get as efficient as possible with regards to when people send different file types around. We've preconfigured some advice for you. Let me show you how to get, download and use our preconfigured advice."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:'What you can do is log into the "Endpoint Policy Manager Portal" and do what\'s called "Download Advice XMLs." It\'s actually a big download because it has a bunch of things in it. The thing you\'re after is what\'s called the "Endpoint Policy Manager File Associations Manager XMLs." Here are some of them. These are the ones we\'re starting off with as of this video.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:'The idea is that we have "Acrobat," "DC," "Classic," "Continuous," "Adobe Reader 11" and so on.

You\'re going to click on "Import Collection," and then I have this hanging out on the "Desktop" over here. Then you\'re going to pick the thing you want. For instance, I have Acrobat Reader 11 on my endpoint, so I\'m going to go ahead and pick "Adobe Reader 11" right there.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"When you do this, you see we've got a little collection.

You just click on "Import Collection" and pick the one you want, "Reader DC (Classic)," and there you go. But how do you make it so that these things don\'t collide into each other?
