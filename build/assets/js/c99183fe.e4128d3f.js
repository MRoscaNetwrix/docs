In this video I'm going to show you how you can use Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)'s Scripts & Triggers Manager to set off any kind of script you want when any kind of event happens in the Event Viewer. I'm going to do kind of a goofy example. I'm going to say when you run GP Update and it's successful on the user side, then open Notepad. Not a great example, but good for our learning."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In real life, you might have an event that writes the event log when your VPN connects. When you do that, then you can run a log on script or something like that. We can also do that if we have support of VPN. If you don't, this is a good option."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"You can also do it any time anything else happens in the event log. I'm just going to use mine as an example.

We need to keep a few things in our head."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We need to know that it's Event 1503, that it's the system log, and it's the Microsoft Windows Group Policy Source.

We'll go to New Policy here."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"I'm going to have a new Batch Script, which is going to start Notepad.exe. I want to do it as the user and interactively. Start Notepad.

Then you click out."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Then you pick the type, which is Microsoft Group Policy. You're going to go Microsoft Windows Group Policy. Then you click out.

That's all there is to it."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We'll leave the Event Viewer open just for a second. I'll go ahead and close out these guys here, just doing some sample test before.
