Let me go to "Control Panel" and "Uninstall a program" here and show you that these applications aren\'t actually really installed. No, of course, they\'re coming down from the "Symantec Workspace Streaming Agent" and will, of course, be processed by the "Symantec Workspace Virtualization Agent." They\'re not really installed; they\'re virtualized.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'When I go ahead and run "WinZip" here for the first time, as you might expect, it\'s streamed down from the Symantec Workspace Streaming server and, as we can see, processed by the Symantec Workspace Virtualization server.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When this occurs, well, there are some problems \u2013 and there they are \u2013 which is that users are right away prompted for settings that maybe they don't know what to do. Should it check for updates? Should it not check for updates? What about the security settings about the application and all that?"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'By way of example here, if I say "And don\'t ask me again," right away that\'s a problem for the user. You don\'t want to be in that situation. Additionally, if you go to "Options/Configuration\u2026"here and "Passwords,"maybe you want to make sure that the password strength or any other important security settings are actually delivered dynamically using Group Policy or Altiris or SCCM or whatever management technology you have. PolicyPakis the magic. It can be deployed using, like I said, either Group Policy or Altiris or SCCM, anything like that..'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'For instance, here we go. We\'ve got "Passwords" here. We want to make these settings configuration changes. Maybe we want to lock out "Cameras." You can\'t do any of these things using normal Group Policy, but you can using PolicyPak.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go ahead and see that work end-to-end here. Here, this is my Group Policy console. Again, I happen to be using Group Policy in these examples. You don't have to. You can use a full deployment tool like SCCM, like Altiris if you want to."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'I\'m going to call this "WinZip and other apps Lockdown." I\'ll right click over here. I\'ll click "Edit," and I\'ll dive down under "User Configuration."

You can see that they\'re listed here, things like "Acrobat Reader,""Acrobat Pro,""Flash,""Java,""Office,""Firefox" and tons of other important applications. If you are virtualizing them and streaming them using the Symantec products, you can now manage those products using PolicyPak.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let\'s go right to"WinZip" here, because that\'s the one we\'re talking about here. We\'ll go ahead and double click it. The first thing you should notice is that our Pak looks just like the application. If we head on over to "Passwords" here, we want to check all these important checkboxes and maybe update "Minimum password length" to "11."'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That's great, but that's not enough. Let's really ensure that user is locked down.

Let's go ahead and run \"gpupdate\" here. Now again, if you're using a management utility like SCCM or Altiris, that's perfectly fine. You can deploy your directives using those utilities. You don't have to be dependent upon Group Policy if you don't want to. We just happen to work with Group Policy if that's what you do want to."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Alright, now that GPUpdate is completed, let\'s go ahead and rerun "WinZip" here. Now let\'s head on over to "Options/Configuration\u2026,"go over to "Passwords" and there we go. PolicyPak is the magic. It has delivered these directives plus performed the UI lockdown here under this setting, these settings, checked all four checkboxes and eliminated the ability to use the "Cameras" tab.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Now if we uncheck these checkmarks and click "OK," you might wonder what happens if a user goes offline or it doesn\'t have contact to a domain controller or anything like that. Well, PolicyPak has the ability to reapply those settings at application launch time. Even if a user is offline or in a subway or in Alaska or wherever, no problem. The next time the application is run, those settings are instantly redelivered just like that.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's do another one. Let's go ahead and go to \"Mozilla Firefox,\" a very common application. Let's go ahead and run Firefox. Let's just see it real fast come down through the Symantec Workspace Streaming and then utilized using Symantec Workspace Virtualization. As soon as this is done, though, the question is, how are you going to actually configure and manage the application using either Group Policy or your systems management utility? The answer without PolicyPak is, impossible practically."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'What we\'ll do is we\'ll go ahead and take a look inside Firefox for some key configuration settings. Let\'s just go to "Firefox/Options." Let\'s take a look at some things that users typically like to mess up. The "Home Page,"maybe you want to configure a homepage for the users. Under "Security," let\'s say the user unchecks all three of these important checkboxes. That\'s not good. They can just click "OK," work around your settings.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Even if you imbed them into the corporate image, there's really no way for you to dynamically manage these settings afterward and also optionally lock it down.

Let\'s go ahead and run "Mozilla Firefox" and see if our settings were set dynamically using PolicyPak. We\'ll go to "Firefox/Options." There we go. The "Security" tab shows that all three settings were set, and the "General" tab shows that "',(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://www.policypak.com",children:"www.policypak.com"}),'"',' is the now "Home Page."']}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:['If they change this to "',(0,n.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://www.oops.com",children:"www.oops.com"}),'"'," and they do something they shouldn't do, click \"OK\" and click close, well the next time Firefox is run, whether or not they're online or offline, those settings are in fact redelivered.Like I said, you can if you want to, lock these settings down if you're so inclined. I just happen not to be showing that in this demonstration."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That's it. The best part about PolicyPakis that it doesn't matter if your applications are real installed or virtual installed.
