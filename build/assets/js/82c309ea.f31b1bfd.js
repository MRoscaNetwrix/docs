We're going to look at deploying BitLocker. With more and more out of the office in potentially less secure locations, protecting data from theft is of increasing importance.

In this video we'll look at a simple no-touch rollout of BitLocker to a group of users using Endpoint Policy Manager Application Template Manager and Scripts Manager."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Other than a reboot, the user doesn't have to do a thing.
