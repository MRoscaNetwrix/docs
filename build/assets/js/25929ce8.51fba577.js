I\'ve got nothing configured in particular for my password policies. If I were to take a look at my "Local Policies/Security Options," all these are pretty important settings that you may want to configure. I\'m just going to configure one for the sake of example called "Accounts: Rename guest account." I\'m going to go ahead and close this out before continuing.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'If I go over to PolicyPak Cloud land, it\'s pretty easy to do. All you need to do is to "Create and link a new Policy" here. I\'m doing this to the "All" group or you could do it to a specific group. I\'m going to pick the "Security Settings Manager." This is easy, "PP SEC DEMO 123," give it a "Policy name." You just point and click. Couldn\'t be easier.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'We\'re going to go down first to "Local Policies/Security Options," and let\'s go ahead and select "Accounts: Rename guest account."

There we go.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'By the way, if you couldn\'t find the setting you were looking for, all you have to do is type in the "Keyword" here like "guest."

So if, for instance, we\'re looking for "password" settings, all the password settings are going to show up right here which makes it pretty easy.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go ahead and click through them.
