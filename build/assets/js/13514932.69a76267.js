In other videos, we talked about setting default browsers, routing the right website to the right browser, and making sure that the naughty websites are blocked.

Just to show that it's working, let's click on microsoft.com here and see it opening in Chrome, just as expected. Now, let's go over to my management station, and we're going to create a new policy here.

If I'm already in IE and I go to microsoft.com, it would render me in IE7 Document Mode, but if I was in Firefox and went to microsoft.com, it would just leave me in Firefox. That said, in this case, I do want to make a route, so I'm going to leave this box unchecked. I'm going to select OK and head back over to the endpoint.

Remember, last time we did this it opened up in our default browser, which is Chrome. This time, though, it's opening in Internet Explorer, and notice that it's rendering really, really poorly right now. That's because we currently have it in a document mode that it's not designed for. However, it is a good visual to see that we did in fact achieve a different rendering mode. To be more specific, though, if you hit F12, you can see developer tools, and you can see under the Emulation tab that we are rendering here in IE7 Document Mode."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now I want to show you another magic trick. Say you have some website that needs to be opened in Internet Explorer but you're using Edge as your standard. You might not want to have to flipflop between browsers all the time, but what can you do? You'll just make Internet Explorer open in Edge. Let me show you how easy this is. I'm going to go here and edit the policy, and while we can render an IE page in Edge with a specific document mode, I want to do one thing at a time. Let's put this back into default mode and change this drop down to Open as IE in Edge tab. Alright. We'll say OK, come back to the end point, and run one last gpupdate."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Alright, now that that's done, we're going to click on microsoft.com again, and again, last time we did this, it was opening in Internet Explorer in IE7 Document Mode. This time it's going to open in Edge as an Internet Explorer tab. Let's see it happen. Here we go. We see that it is opening in Edge right down here. However, there is your Internet Explorer mode tab. There you have it. That is how easy it is to set up an Internet Explorer Enterprise or document mode easily and quickly as well as forcing an Internet Explorer tab open inside of Edge.
