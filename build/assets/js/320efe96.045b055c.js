We are going to set Security to Very High, and we are going to Lock this down using the system-wide config file, so we're getting very serious with this. If I come over here to Advanced, we are going to only use TLS 1.2. We are going to uncheck these two, and we can Lock that down using the system-wide config file as well, and I'm going to right-lick and lock that one down.

We're going to come over here to the Extras, and Extras, you have to scroll down just a little bit to find the setting about the incognito mode, so there we go.

Now that that MSI has been deployed on to this machine, we can go over, and we can check out Java over here. You're going to notice that the Update tab is gone. That's great. We tore the knob off of that one. Come over to Security, you're going to notice that I can't click on this at all. That's because we locked it down with that system-wide config file, and when I come over here to Advanced, I can scroll down and find yep, we are only using TLS1.2, and we are restricting TLS 1.1 and 1.0."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We did that, and when I come over here to Chrome, you're going to notice there our homepage is policypak.com just like we asked it to. No incognito mode option anymore, and when I come down to Settings and I go to that Autofill area \u2013 Autofill, Passwords, there we go. You see that this setting is being enforced by your administrator, and it's grayed out. I cannot click that at all, at all. That is how you can go about managing the application settings using PolicyPak, but getting rid of Group Policy and using SCCM instead. If this is of interest to you, get in touch with us. We'll have you watch a webinar. We'll give you the bits, and you can get started on your trial right away.
