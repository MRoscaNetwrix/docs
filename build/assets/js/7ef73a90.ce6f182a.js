You can do this on any machine you have access to.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:'There are two methods. There\'s what we call "Quick Search" and "Full Search." "Quick Search" will look through all Group Policy Objects that report to us instantly that they have licenses. I\'ll just expand this. You can see, I\'ve got a handful of licenses here.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:'If you have the time, you can go "Back" and click instead to do the "Full Search," which is going to query every Group Policy Object and look for licenses.

It will automatically fix a slight issue we had with old licenses.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:'Once that\'s done, you can see we have all the licenses here that are available to us.

While I'm here, you can optionally \"Unlink GPOs from OUs\" if you know that you're only using these GPOs for licensing. If you're not sure, you can leave that unchecked.

I should have all my components. I only see four of my six components. There are a couple of ways you can do that. My preferred technique \u2013 and you've seen me probably do this in other videos \u2013 I'm going to go back to this other machine. I'm going to use the GPMC here. In that last remaining licensing Group Policy Object here I'm going to right click, click \"Edit.\""}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:'I\'ll just right click on the "PolicyPak" node, click on "License Management," click "Import," and find the two items that I don\'t have.
