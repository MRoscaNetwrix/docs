I\'m just a guy called "eastsalesuser4," a standard user, no admin rights. Even a standard user can get into all sorts of mischief.

That\'s good, but the user just clicks it, closes out Chrome, and now they\'re not protected \u2013 not good for you. Just to prove a point here, if I go back to "Settings" here and go back to "Show advanced settings," you can see that\'s not being enforced in any meaningful way.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"That's thing number one. Thing number two, let's say this idea here, \"Offer to save passwords I enter on the web,\" not good if it is checked. Let me say that again. If this checkmark is checked, that's not good because then this machine becomes less secure. The bad guy steals a laptop, and they can start surfing the websites that your users have used, and then they can get into all sorts of places that you probably don't want to bad guys to go. You want this unchecked, but how are you going to do that? That's what we're going to show you next."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:'Lastly, let\'s take a look at "Content settings." One of the scariest settings overall is "Ask me when a site requires access to my camera and microphone." The user can just say, "Yes, I would like to do that," and the camera turns on, the microphone turns on and your secrets go right out the door. Instead, wouldn\'t it be better to "Do not allow sites to access my camera and microphone"? I\'m going to show you how to do that.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:'Let\'s go ahead and close this out and go over to the Group Policy editor. We\'ll "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here\u2026" and we\'ll call this "Manage Chrome using PolicyPak." Click "Edit" here, and we\'ll dive down under user side, "PolicyPak/Applications/New/Application" and there it is \u2013 "PolicyPak for Google Chrome" \u2013 as well as lots of other great applications like "Internet Explorer," "Java," "Lync," "Mozilla Firefox," "Adobe Reader." Actually, we have about 100 Paks, so you can just snap those in and you\'re ready to rock.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"We'll go ahead and pick \"PolicyPak for Google Chrome\" here, and let's go ahead and dictate our settings.

We just happen to be using Group Policy in these examples."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:'Now that that\'s all done, let\'s go ahead and run "Google Chrome" and see what happens.
