In this video I'm going to show you how you can push the PolicyPak Cloud Immutable Log Data to your own system for further processing. The idea is here you are in the PolicyPak Cloud console. Here are the company details. If you head over to Customer Log, you'll see the customer log that gives you all sorts of interesting information. We try to log darn near everything that happens at PolicyPak Cloud."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Maybe you want to parse this for interesting events that happen. No problem. What you can do then is you can use what's called our push configuration. You can add a new email address. We might have other types of push at some point, but right now we have email address."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"You can do daily, weekly, or monthly. Daily is going to show you everything that happens today or one 24-hour period, Weekly for a week, and, of course, monthly for a month. The question might be when does this stuff actually get sent?"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"These all send at the same time, which is 10 to 11 UCT, Universal Coordinated Time, daily, so 10 to 11 Universal Coordinated Time daily. Weekly we'll do that about every Monday. Then monthly we'll do it 10 to 11 UTC every first of the month. This is not configurable. Then the idea here is that let's say you pick weekly. You can also run a test. The test you run will show you the stuff from this previous week or previous month or the day. If you want to do weekly, let's go ahead and do that."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"I'm going to give it my email address. The thing is, my email address isn't registered here in PolicyPak Cloud as an admin in this account. We're going to get a little error. When I go ahead and click OK here, it's going to say Are You Sure You Want to Do This? This guy, I don't know. He seems a little sketchy. That's okay because you might want to have that inbox not be part of your PolicyPak Cloud admins. That's totally fine, so just be aware of that."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"The other piece about this is that that data is going to be encrypted when we deliver it. It's going to be an encrypted zip file. Great, how do you know what the password is? You can do what's called renew the password. This will change the password. I'll go ahead and copy that for now. If you ever forget what that password is, you can always just come back here and click on Show Password. When you renew and you've got a new one, Show password will show you what the existing one is."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Now let's do a quick test push. I'll go ahead and do a quick test push. Now that we've done the push, I'm just going to wait for it to come to my email. Then I'll pause the video and come back, and we can unpack it. Now we're back. I got the email. Let's go ahead and right click or we'll just double-click on this guy. Let's drag and drop it. What are we going to get? It's encrypted, so let's go ahead and hit the password in there.
