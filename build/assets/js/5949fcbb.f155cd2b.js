I'll go to Application Settings Manager here. Right-click New Application and there it is, Microsoft Teams. Again, I've already slid this in. This is coming from the central store.

Now it's time to go over as us here and we'll go to Settings and there we go. We flipped all the bits.

I'm actually going to accelerate the log off and log on process with a little movie magic here. Now let's go ahead and run Teams.
