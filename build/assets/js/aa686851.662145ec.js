We will also ask for log files from that machine after you have reproduced the issue. In other words, as a general rule, we will typically not begin to investigate your issue unless you can reproduce it on a machine with the latest CSE. There is no value in investigating old CSE behavior because the problem could already be fixed in the latest version, and logging improvements could be present in the latest CSEs.
