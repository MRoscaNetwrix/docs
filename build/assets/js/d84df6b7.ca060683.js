You can do this either on the user or computer side. It doesn\'t matter. I\'m just going to do it on the user side.

You can see that we\'ve got pretty much all the big hitters for Firefox here.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:'Let\'s just set the "Home Page" anyway just for fun just so we can also see that working.

Actually, I want to put this on the "menu" here, and I want to "add" that. That\'s the first thing I want to do.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:'The second thing I want to do \u2013 and I have this as one of the pre-canned examples here \u2013 is also a menu item called "Mozilla Firefox\\About Us."
