We've got like, I don't know, 90 things. Then we're going to use Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager. Endpoint Policy Manager Scripts Manager is a built-in thing for us.

Who's in charge? Us or the users? It's us.\" Or \"Once,\" which is what we're going to do here, or \"Once or when forced.\"Let's just do it one time and never again. We'll go ahead and click on \"Next\" here. We'll call this \"remove junk apps,\" and we're ready to rock. It's just that simple.
