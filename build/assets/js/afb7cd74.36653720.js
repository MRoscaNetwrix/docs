Then reinstall that cloud client on your machine and then have it check back in with your cloud instance here."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The "Strict" versus "Loose" tells you what happens in that kind of a situation.

I know you. Come on in," and leave the computer in its original groups.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Let me show you what I mean by this.

It does something a little bit unusual, but it is expected. Basically, what happens is once the cloud client gets nuked on your machine, the machine stays in these groups.
