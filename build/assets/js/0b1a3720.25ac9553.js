As you go into a policy to create a new one or edit an existing, you'll notice with the latest CSEs that we've kind of combined all the different components that make up PolicyPak into individual packs or folders, as they appear here. There's six different ones. These kind of align to the new licensing strategy that PolicyPak has going forward.
