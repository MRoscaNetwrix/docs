That's the first thing you're going to want to do. The second thing you're going to want to do is to understand this idea called Join Token. We have other videos on Join Token or Link Join. The basic gist is that you can automatically connect a computer at install time to one or more groups.

You can dictate that."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Then using the join token, you're magically connecting to work to your particular group or groups.
