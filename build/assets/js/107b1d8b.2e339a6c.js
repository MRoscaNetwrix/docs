To make things go a little bit faster for this video, I'm doing something that's a little unusual.

That\'s the secret sauce here.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The next thing we want to do is give it a "Shortcut Name," so I\'ll call this "WVD Firefox." You can give it any name you want. Let me go ahead and also "Change icon."

That\'s all there is to it, and we\'ll go ahead and click "Next."'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'We can make it a "Medium" icon or a "Small" icon and we can change exactly what "Column" and "Row" it\'s in.

So let's go ahead and fix that problem."}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:['So the first thing we want to do is change the "Target Application." Like I said, we\'re going to go ahead and change the username over to "',(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"%username%@%userDNSdomain%."}),"\" Okay, we've got that guy.

Now again, because the icon didn\'t shine through for some reason, we have a couple choices. Choice number one is to point to an application that exists locally on the Desktop. That would work, and then you can pull the icons from there. Another choice is to "Look for icons in Shell32" because we know that\'s going to be on every machine. Then you can pick an icon like this little star guy here or something like that. And we\'ll go ahead and click "Medium" as well.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Why don\'t I do one more, and the thing I want to do is a full Desktop here. So maybe I\'ll pick this guy here: "Win10 on Hostpool1." I\'ll go and get these "Properties" here. So we\'re really just doing the same thing again and again. So we\'ll go ahead and click on "Add" a "New Desktop Application Tile," "Custom application." We\'re going to paste that in and click "Next."'}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["We're going to change the username part over to \"",(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"%username%@%userDNSdomain%."}),'" Okay, and then the last mile again is to find the reference to local app data for that guy and then move it to "',(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"%localappdata%."}),'"']}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'All right, so then we\'ll call this "Full WVD Desktop," and then we\'ll change the icon.

We\'ll go ahead and click "Next." We\'ll make this a "Small" icon, do something a little different.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now here's the thing. You probably want this particular \"WVD Apps\" group to only hit when you're on your real machines. You probably don't want this same Start Screen layout to show up when you're in a virtual desktop. So how do I do that? Well, we need some criteria to know what our machines are."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Now this machine I\'m actually on, if I type "hostname," this machine I\'m actually on is "Computer10." All my real machines start with the word "Computer" in it. Okay, well, if I know that, I can say only deliver the "WVD Apps" group when a certain condition is true. That\'s called item-level targeting.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'What I\'m going to do is I\'m going to select "Change Group Level Targeting" and say when the "Computer Name" matches "*computer*"\u2014only when it matches that\u2014then it lights up orange which means only do this stuff when that condition is true. So that\'s pretty nifty.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The last thing I want to do is to take some work that I already did here in Firefox, take this "Target Application," and we\'re going to recycle that and also shove that into the "Taskbar Manager for Windows 10."'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'So we\'ll create a new Taskbar collection ("Add Collection") and we\'ll "Merge" it with whatever is already there. Then we\'ll create a new item here. So "Add" a "New Desktop Application." Again, we\'ll make it a "Custom application," and this is on the Taskbar. We\'ve already done the work. We\'ve already replaced everything we need to for Firefox. We\'ve already got the username there and the local app data. We\'re ready to rock.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'We\'ll just go ahead and put the right icon in here. It doesn\'t really matter what this is called: "WVD FF." "Change icon" to the correct "Firefox" icon. Right click, "Properties," "Change icon." Grab that, paste that in here. Okay, so that\'s it. That\'s how you plant an icon on the Taskbar. That\'s it. That\'s all there is to it.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to close all this out, and now let's go ahead and run GP Update (\"gpupdate\") on this machine. That's going to get us the latest, greatest settings here to verify that we got what we wanted. And then after this, we'll see our results when we log off and log back on. That's when we're going to see the activity happen. So we'll do this first. We'll log off and log back on.

You can see the little icon is available to note that it's there from WVD."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's go ahead and also just for fun \"Sign out\" here. We'll go ahead and log on as \"EastSalesUser2\" here. He's going to get a very similar experience to EastSalesUser1.
