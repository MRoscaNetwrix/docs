# Jobs with Errors

Identity Manager is able to send notification emails when a job ends with an error. The notification
email is sent to the user who has the necessary rights and the permission.

See the [ Native Notifications ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/notifications/native/index.md) and
[ Profiles & Permissions ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/profiles-permissions/index.md) topics for additional
information.
