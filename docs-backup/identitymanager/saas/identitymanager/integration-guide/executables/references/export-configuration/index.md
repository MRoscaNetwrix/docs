# Usercube-Export-Configuration

Generates in a folder the files of the configuration found in the database.

While the deployment process is about taking the configuration elements from the XML files to insert
them in the database, the export process is about taking the configuration elements from the
database to generate XML files:

- A basic export will export the XML configuration that was latest deployed to the database,
  including images like logos and favicons;
- A marked export will export the whole configuration as XML files, including the configuration
  elements created via the UI;

  As Identity Manager can be configured by writing manually in XML files and/or using the UI, the
  marked export helps combining both.

  Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube) recommends configuring Identity Manager via the UI
  as much as possible, and completing the configuration via XML files when needed.

- a basic export will export the translation JSON files;
- a scaffolding export will export the XML configuration generated by scaffoldings.

![Schema - Export Process](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/executables/references/export-configuration/identitymanager-export-configuration.webp)

For all export types, Netwrix Identity Manager (formerly Usercube) recommends using as output
directory a folder other than the one containing the old XML configuration. This way, the exported
configuration does not overwrite the old one, and:

- the changes can be clearly viewed in a file comparison tool;
- the interesting changes can be selected individually and inserted in the old configuration, to
  update the configuration while keeping any manual changes such as comments.

### Focus on the marked export

By default, the configuration elements created via the UI are stored in the database just like the
rest of the configuration, but they are not included in deployment and export processes.

While UI elements are not marked, they are not included in the XML/database comparison performed
during the configuration deployment process. It means that deploying any configuration will not
affect UI elements.

On the other hand, once UI elements are marked, they will be included in the XML/database comparison
performed during the next configuration deployment process. Then, if these UI elements are not in
the deployed XML files, they will be removed from the database.

Be careful about what configuration to deploy and export.

When configuring through both the UI and XML files, make sure to:

- Export all UI modifications before making changes in XML files and deploying the configuration
  again;
- Deploy all XML modifications before making changes in the UI and exporting the configuration
  again.

## Examples

### Locally vs. remotely

The following example exports an on-premise configuration via a direct connection to the database
through its connection string:

```

./identitymanager-Export-Configuration.exe -d "C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf" --database-connection-string "data source=.;Database=Usercube;Integrated Security=SSPI;Min Pool Size=10;encrypt=false;"

```

The following example exports a SaaS configuration via an HTTP POST request to the server of the
remote configuration:

```

./identitymanager-Export-Configuration.exe -d "C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf" --api-url https://my_usercube_instance.com

```

To be able to export a SaaS configuration, you must first provide your Identity
Manager administrator with identity information. See the
[ Export the Configuration ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/how-tos/export-configuration/index.md) topic for
additional information.

### Basic export for a change of environment

The following example exports all configuration elements of the database as a set of XML files, to
the `C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf` folder, for example to move from the pre-production environment to
the production environment.

```

./identitymanager-Export-Configuration.exe --database-connection-string "data source=.;Database=Usercube;Integrated Security=SSPI;Min Pool Size=10;encrypt=false;" --configuration-directory "C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf"

```

All XML files from `C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf` are removed and replaced with the new set of XML
files, generated based on the configuration elements from the database.

The default behavior of this tool exports all XML files, from the configuration elements stored in
the database and the XML/database relationships, as well as logos and favicons. Translations are not
exported.

Most modifications made in the UI will be ignored too.

### Export UI configuration elements outside the role model

The following example exports all configuration elements as a set of XML files, including the
configuration modifications made through the UI, except any elements linked to the role model.

```

./identitymanager-Export-Configuration.exe --database-connection-string "data source=.;Database=Usercube;Integrated Security=SSPI;Min Pool Size=10;encrypt=false;" --configuration-directory "C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf" --mark-for-export

```

All XML files from `C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf` are removed and replaced with the new set of XML
files, generated based on the configuration elements from the database, including UI elements (not
role-model-related) that are now marked for export.

### Export all UI configuration elements

The following example exports all configuration elements as a set of XML files, including all
configuration modifications made through the UI, especially role-model-related elements.

```

./identitymanager-Export-Configuration.exe --database-connection-string "data source=.;Database=Usercube;Integrated Security=SSPI;Min Pool Size=10;encrypt=false;" --configuration-directory "C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf" --mark-for-export --mark-rolemodel-for-export

```

All XML files from `C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf` are removed and replaced with the new set of XML
files, generated based on the configuration elements from the database, including all UI elements
that are now marked for export.

### Export translation files

The following example exports to `C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf` the JSON translation files stored in the
database, one per language, replacing the ancient versions potentially pre-existing in the output
directory.

```

./identitymanager-Export-Configuration.exe --database-connection-string "data source=.;Database=Usercube;Integrated Security=SSPI;Min Pool Size=10;encrypt=false;" --configuration-directory "C:/identitymanager/ExportedConf" --export-translation

```

### Export scaffoldings for debug

The following example exports XML files containing the configuration generated by all scaffoldings.
It exports one folder per scaffolding type, and in each folder one XML file per scaffolding,
containing the configuration generated by the scaffolding.

```

./identitymanager-Export-Configuration.exe --database-connection-string "data source=.;Database=Usercube;Integrated Security=SSPI;Min Pool Size=10;encrypt=false;" --configuration-directory "C:/identitymanager/ConfScaffoldings" --export-scaffolding

```

All XML files from `C:/identitymanager/ConfScaffoldings` are removed and replaced with the new set of XML
files, generated based on the scaffoldings from the configuration.

The scaffolding export's output is meant only for viewing in debug situations and must not be
inserted in the configuration.
