# Resource Type

In Identity Manager a resource type is a conceptual model used to categorize resources. It groups
together, with a meaningful name, resources sharing the same intent and the same authorization
system. Resource types are assigned directly to a resource rather than mapped to a role. A resource
type can be assigned manually, or configured to be assigned automatically via a resource type rule.

## Examples

The following example declares a new resource type to provision the LDAP service accounts:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="LDAP_Entry_ServiceEntry" DisplayName_L1="LDAP Entry (service)" Policy="Default" TargetEntityType="LDAP_Entry" Category="LDAP" SourceEntityType="Directory_Application" />
```

### ArgumentsExpression

This option is used for provisioning orders to compute useful arguments.

Most standard situations use only one workflow per action type on a resource (addition, update,
deletion). But in some more complex situations (like using multi records), several workflows are
available for one type of action. As the configuration JSON file of an InternalWorkflow connection
cannot contain expressions, a resource type can be configured with the ArgumentsExpression attribute
to explicit the arguments of provisioning orders, based on conditions and variables. See the
[InternalWorkflow](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/connectors/references-connectors/internalworkflow/index.md),
[ Compute a Resource Type's Provisioning Arguments ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/provisioning/how-tos/argumentsexpression/index.md),
and [Expressions](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/expressions/index.md) topics for additional information.

The following example computes the identifier of the workflow to launch, based on the provisioning
order as a variable (the returned value depends here mostly on the type of change):

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="HR_Person_To_Directory_UserRecord" DisplayName_L1="User Record (from HR)" DisplayName_L2="Fiche de collaborateur (source RH)" Category="HR" Policy="Default" TargetEntityType="Directory_UserRecord" SourceEntityType="HR_Person" CorrelateMultipleResources="true" ArgumentsExpression="C#:resource:
    
  if ((provisioningOrder == null) || (provisioningOrder.ChangeType.IsNone() {
    return null;
  }
  var arguments = new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<string, string>();
  var workflowIdentifier = "Directory_User_UpdateFromHR";
  if ((provisioningOrder.ChangeType.IsAdded()) || (provisioningOrder.HasChanged("Employee_Id") {
    workflowIdentifier = "Directory_User_StartInternalByHR";
  }
  else if (provisioningOrder.ChangeType.IsDeleted()) {
    workflowIdentifier = "Directory_User_DeleteFromHR";
  }
  arguments.Add("WorkflowIdentifier", workflowIdentifier);
  return arguments;" />
```

#### ResourceIdToCopy

Now consider a record creation for a given identity, inside a multi-record organization. Suppose
that records are defined by their position and location, while other properties are the same for all
records (usually the identity's personal data like the name and birth date). When creating a new
record for an existing identity, you will want to copy an existing record from the database to
modify only the values specific to the new record.

The following example computes the identifier of the record to copy, if the identity has already
any:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="HR_Person_To_Directory_UserRecord" DisplayName_L1="User Record (from HR)" DisplayName_L2="Fiche de collaborateur (source RH)" Category="HR" Policy="Default" TargetEntityType="Directory_UserRecord" SourceEntityType="HR_Person" CorrelateMultipleResources="true" ArgumentsExpression="C#:resource:
if ((provisioningOrder == null) || (provisioningOrder.ChangeType.IsNone() {
  return null;
}
var arguments = new System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<string, string>();
if (provisioningOrder.TryGetScalar("EmployeeId", out var employeeId) && (employeeId != null)) {  
  var resources = queryHandler.Select<Directory_UserRecord>("Select Id Where EmployeeId="\" + employeeId.ToString() + "\"");
  if (resources.Any()) {
    arguments.Add("ResourceIdToCopy", resources.FirstOrDefault().Id.ToString());
  }
}  
return arguments;" />
```

### DependsOn

This option is used to configure another resource type as prerequisite for this resource type.

For example, a Microsoft Exchange account requires the email address of a related Active Directory
account.

In this case, we want to configure the Exchange Account resource type so that a user cannot own an
Exchange account when they do not own an AD account.

The following example is meant to perform an automatic check to prevent the execution of any
provisioning order for the creation of an Exchange account when the user does not own an AD
nominative account.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="Exchange" DisplayName_L1="Exchange Account" Policy="Default" TargetEntityType="Exchange" Category="Accounts" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ApprovalWorkflowType="ManualAssignmentNotAllowed" DependsOn="AD_Entry_NominativeUser">
```

### DependsOnOwnerProperty

This option is used to configure a property as prerequisite for the resource type.

Consider an Active Directory administrator account which should be able to perform manual
provisioning to ServiceNow. Then it requires the random identifier computed by ServiceNow.

In this case, we want to configure the AD_Entry_AdministrationUser resource type so that a user
cannot own an AD administrator account when they do not have an identifier in ServiceNow.

**NOTE:** The DependsOnOwnerProperty of a resource type should only refer to scalar values that are
part of the properties of the SourceEntityType.

The following example is meant to perform an automatic check to prevent the execution of any
provisioning order for the creation of an AD administrator account when the user does not have an
identifier in ServiceNow.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="AD_Entry_AdministrationUser" DisplayName_L1="AD User (Administration)" Policy="Default" TargetEntityType="AD_Entry" Category="Accounts" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ApprovalWorkflowType="ManualAssignmentNotAllowed" DependsOnOwnerProperty="ServiceNow:identifier">
```

### DiscardManualAssignments

This option is used to set Identity Manager as authoritative following a manual change in a managed
system.

Suppose a resource type managing the provisioning of Active Directory nominative accounts based on
users data in Identity Manager (Directory_User). Suppose a scalar rule that provisions the AD's sn
property based on users' last names.

The following scenario is about a user named Cedric Blanc, whose AD's sn property is set by the
scalar rule to Blanc.

![Example - State 0](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/discardmanualassignments_state0_v602.webp)

Let's see what happens when the user's name is changed manually directly in the AD.

Suppose that we change in the AD the last name to White. As the scalar rule computes the sn value
based on the user's data which still states the last name Blanc, such a change induces a difference
between the value calculated by the rule and the actual value in the AD. This difference is spotted
by the next synchronization, triggering a non-conforming assignment on the Resource Reconciliation
page.

![Example - State 1](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/discardmanualassignments_state1_v602.webp)

![Example - Step 1](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/discardmanualassignments_step1_v602.webp)

![Example - Step 2](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/discardmanualassignments_step2_v602.webp)

Once this manual new value is confirmed, the property is stated as **Approved**.

![Example - State 2](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/discardmanualassignments_state2_v602.webp)

Now suppose that the user's last name is changed to Black via Identity Manager's workflows. As the
source data is changed, the scalar rule computes a new value for sn. There are two options:

- The default configuration (DiscardManualAssignments set to false) considers manual assignments,
  i.e. changes made directly in the managed system, as authoritative. So there will be no
  provisioning of the newly computed value for sn. The current sn value that was written manually in
  the AD stays as is, no matter the changes in the source data (here the user's last name). Identity
  Manager only states the property's value as Questioned.

  ![Example - State 3](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/discardmanualassignments_state3_v602.webp)

  **NOTE:** No change in the source data can affect the property's value. However, any manual
  change made in the managed system will trigger a non-conforming assignment. Then, reconciling
  the property by choosing to keep Identity Manager's suggested value will make the property's
  value go back to Calculated and thus follow the changes in the source data.

  **NOTE:** If DiscardManualAssignments is changed from False to True, then the state of the
  property's value does not matter. Identity Manager applies the rules of the role model, and
  generates a provisioning order to overwrite the manual change White with the newly computed
  value Black.

  ![Example - State 4](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/discardmanualassignments_state4_v602.webp)

In this scenario for Cedric Blanc, these behaviors can be summed up like the following:

### Correlate Multiple Resources

With the **Correlation Multiple Resources** option, Identity Manager can link a single owner to
several existing target objects of the same resource type. This setting can be used in conjunction
with the **Suggest all resources** option to fine tune the behavior.

Below, we illustrate the different scenarios that are possible, taking into consideration whether a
resource type has previously been correlated to the owner or not.

![suggestallcorrelations-nnn](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-nnn.webp)

- The value for both **Correlate Multiple Resources** and **Suggest All Correlations** is **No**
  there is no Resource already correlated so the first match with the highest confidence rate is
  **Correlated** if it is > 100 or **Suggested** if it is < 100. As for all other matches with lower
  confidence rate they will be ignored.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-nnn2](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-nnn2.webp)

  If there are no Resources to be correlated with a confidence rate >100, the ones below with
  confidence rate below 100 are Suggested or Ignored.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-nny](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-nny.webp)

- The value for both **Correlate Multiple Resources** and **Suggest All Correlations** is **No**
  there is one Resource already correlated so due to this all future correlations will be ignored.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-nyn](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-nyn.webp)

- The value for **Correlate Multiple Resources** is **No**, **Suggest All Correlations** is **Yes**
  there is no Resource already correlated so all Resource Types will be **Suggested**.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-nyy](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-nyy.webp)

- The value for **Correlate Multiple Resources** is **No**, **Suggest All Correlations** **Yes**
  there is one Resource already correlated so the Resource Types that have a confidence rate `>100`
  will be **Suggested**. As for all other matches with lower confidence rate they will be ignored.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-ynn](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-ynn.webp)

- The value for **Correlate Multiple Resources** is **Yes**, **Suggest All Correlations** **No**,
  and there is no Resource already correlated so Resource Types that have a confidence rate `>100`
  will be **Correlated** and the ones `<100` will be **Suggested** if there are no higher matches
  otherwise they will be ignored.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-ynn2](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-ynn2.webp)

  If there are no Resources to be correlated with a confidence rate `>100`, the ones with
  confidence rate below 100 are Suggested.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-yny](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-yny.webp)

- The value for **Correlate Multiple Resources** is **Yes**, **Suggest All Correlations** **No**
  there is one Resource already correlated so the matches with confidence rate `>100` will be
  **Correlated** and the ones `<100` will be ignored.

  ![suggestallcorrelations-yyny](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/suggestallcorrelations-yyny.webp)

- The value for **Correlate Multiple Resources** is **Yes**, **Suggest All Correlations** **Yes**
  one Resource could be already correlated or not so the matches with confidence rate `>100` will be
  **Correlated** and the ones `<100` will be **Suggested**.

Set to false, any manual change of a property's value made directly in the target system will be "protected" (only after the change is approved in Identity Manager in Resource Reconciliation). It means that a future change in the source data will not trigger the provisioning of the new value to the target system. Instead, Identity Manager will keep the value of the manual change, and state the value as **Questioned**. This option should be set to true when: \* using multiple authoritative sources and the latest value should be provisioned; \* a source system is not often synchronized to Identity Manager but should stay the authoritative source. |

## Child Element: BinaryRule

A ResourceBinaryRule allows to specify the file that must be set to an assigned resource binary
property. It is defined by a child element `<BinaryRule>` of the `<ResourceType>` element. The
source file should already be synchronized and stored inside and reference as an EntityType
property.

### Examples

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
    <ResourceType Identifier="AD_Entry_To_Directory_User" ...>    ...
    <BinaryRule Property="Photo" Binding="thumbnailPhoto" />  </ResourceType>
```

| TimeOffsetReference default value: 0       | TimeOffsetReference | Offset mode defining which dates to use as references, in order to apply the time offset. The time period for which the rule is applied is adjusted accordingly. 0 - Default: the offset inherited from the type rule. 1 - Around: the offset before reference is applied from the start date of the resource, and the offset after reference is applied from the end date. 2 - Before: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the start date of the resource. 3 - After: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the end date of the resource. **NOTE:** in a situation with several binary rules, the order of application is: After, then Before, then Around, then Default. Each rule is able to overwrite those previously applied in case they overlap. _Remember,_ two offsets of the same mode should never overlap. Resources' start and end dates can be configured through record sections and/or context rules. |

## Child Element: NavigationRule

A navigation rule computes the value of a given navigation property for target resources, based on
the properties of their owners (source resources and entitlements). These properties are to be
provisioned, i.e. written to the managed system. Contrary to query rules, navigation rules assign
resources regardless of the attributes of source resources.

A navigation rule is defined by the child element `<NavigationRule>` of the `<ResourceType>`
element.

**NOTE:** Both navigation and query rules compute navigation properties. The value of one navigation
property should be computed by either navigation or query rules, not both.

See the
[ Compute a Navigation Property ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/navigation-property-computation/index.md)
topic for additional information.

### Examples

Computation based on other properties

The following example declares a new rule to give the SG_APP_SharePoint_HR_Owner group to all users
who had the SharePoint_HR_Owner role.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<NavigationRule Property="memberOf" Resource="SG_APP_SharePoint_HR_Owner" SingleRole="SharePoint_HR_Owner" Policy="Default" />
```

The following rule will set users' Active Directory nominative account in the
CN=SG_APP_DL-INTERNET-Restricted,OU=Applications,DC=acme,DC=internal group for people having the
DL-INTERNET-Restricted role.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="AD_Entry_NominativeUser">    ...
    <NavigationRule Property="memberOf" Resource="CN=SG_APP_DL-INTERNET-Restricted,OU=Applications,DC=acme,DC=internal" SingleRole="DL-INTERNET-Restricted" />
</ResourceType>
```

Parametrized roles

The role catalog can be optimized by reducing the number of roles, by configuring parametrized
roles. See the
[Configure a Parametrized Role](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/user-guide/optimize/parameterized-role/index.md)topic
for additional information.

This optimization will simplify the functional understanding of the role catalog, and speed up
Identity Manager's calculations.

Supposing that the 10th dimension (dimension A following the base32hex convention) is created for
time slots, the following example creates a single role Access/A_Brune_HR for all time slots. Each
time-slot-related entitlement will be assigned to users by configuring one navigation rule per
entitlement, using the dimension as a required parameter. See the
[ Dimension ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/metadata/dimension/index.md) and
[ Base32 Parameter Names ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/parameter-names/index.md)topics for additional information.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<SingleRole Identifier="Access/A_Brune_HR" DisplayName_L1="Zone - Brune - HR" DisplayName_L2="Zone - Brune - RH" Category="Access" ApprovalWorkflowType="One" EntityType="Directory_User" Policy="Default" RA="1" /><ResourceType ... >    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_5/7_8/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_5/7_8/24" />    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_5/7_12/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_5/7_12/24" />    <NavigationRule Property="TimeSlot" Resource="TS_7/7_24/24" SingleRole="Access/A_Brune_HR" DA="TS_7/7_24/24" /></ResourceType>
```

| TimeOffsetReference default value: 0       | TimeOffsetReference | _Remember,_ Offset mode defining which dates to use as references, in order to apply the time offset. The time period for which the rule is applied is adjusted accordingly. 0 - Default: the offset inherited from the type rule. 1 - Around: the offset before reference is applied from the start date of the resource, and the offset after reference is applied from the end date. 2 - Before: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the start date of the resource. 3 - After: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the end date of the resource. In a situation with several navigation rules, the order of application is descending (After-Before-Around-Default). Thus each time offset is able to overwrite those previously applied in case they overlap, for mono-valued properties. _Remember,_ two offsets of the same mode should never overlap for mono-valued properties. Overlapping rules on a multi-valued property do not conflict with each other, Identity Manager stores all computed values. Resources' start and end dates can be configured through record sections and/or context rules. |

## Child Element: QueryRule

A query rule computes the value of a given navigation property for target resources, based on the
properties of their owners (source resources and entitlements). These properties are to be
provisioned, i.e. written to the managed system. Contrary to navigation rules, query rules assign
resources to target resources according to a query via a C# expression with conditions, based on the
attributes of the source resources. See the [Expressions](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/expressions/index.md) topic for
additional information.

A query rule is defined by the child element `<QueryRule>` of the `<ResourceType>` element.

Both navigation and query rules compute navigation properties. The value of one navigation property
should be computed by either navigation or query rules, not both.

See the
[ Compute a Navigation Property ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/navigation-property-computation/index.md)
topic for additional information.

### Examples

Computation based on other properties

The following example declares a new rule to compute the parent distinguished name for guest users.
Here we do not use source properties, but a literal expression for all guest users.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="AD_Entry_Guest">    ...
    <QueryRule Property="parentdn" Policy="Default" TargetBinding="AD_Entry:dn" SourceExpression="C#:resource:return "OU=Guests,DC=acme,DC=internal";" TargetMatchedConfidenceLevel="100" />
</ResourceType>
```

| TimeOffsetReference default value: 0          | TimeOffsetReference | TypeDescriptionOffset mode defining which dates to use as references, in order to apply the time offset. The time period for which the rule is applied is adjusted accordingly. 0 - Default: the offset inherited from the type rule. 1 - Around: the offset before reference is applied from the start date of the resource, and the offset after reference is applied from the end date. 2 - Before: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the start date of the resource. 3 - After: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the end date of the resource. In a situation with several query rules, the order of application is descending (After-Before-Around-Default). Thus each time offset is able to overwrite those previously applied in case they overlap, for mono-valued properties. two offsets of the same mode should never overlap for mono-valued properties. Overlapping rules on a multi-valued property do not conflict with each other, Identity Manager stores all computed values. Resources' start and end dates can be configured through record sections and/or context rules. |

## Child Element: ScalarRule

A scalar rule computes the value of a given scalar property for target resources, based on the
properties of their owners (source resources and entitlements). These properties are to be
provisioned, i.e. written to the managed system.

A scalar rule is defined by the child element `<ScalarRule>` of the `<ResourceType>` element.

See the
[Compute a Scalar Property](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/provisioning-rule-creation/scalar-property-computation/index.md)
topic for additional information.

### Examples

Computation based on other properties

The following example shows two scalar rules. The first one computes users' emails based on AD
values. The other one contains a C# expression to compute AccountExpires.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Policy="Default" Identifier="App1_Standard_Account" TargetEntityType="App1_Account" SourceEntityType="Bot">    ...
    <ScalarRule Property="Mail" Binding="AD_Entry:mail" Policy="Default" />  
    <ScalarRule Property="accountExpires" Expression="C#:person:return !person.EndDate.HasValue ? null : person.EndDate.Value.ToSince1601DateString();" />
</ResourceType>
```

The next example computes the firstName property of a App1_Account from the resource type
App1_Standard_Account, indicating that it must be equal to the firstName of the source resource.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Policy="Default" Identifier="App1_Standard_Account" TargetEntityType="App1_Account" SourceEntityType="User">    ...
    <ScalarRule Property="firstName" Binding="User:FirstName" />
</ResourceType>
```

Computation via a literal expression

The following example translates to "the userAccountControl property of a App1_Account of resource
type App1_Standard_Account must be equal to 66048. It uses a literal expression. See the
[Expressions](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/expressions/index.md) topic for additional information.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Policy="Default" Identifier="App1_Standard_Account" TargetEntityType="App1_Account" SourceEntityType="Bot">    ...
    <ScalarRule Property="userAccountControl" Expression="Literal:66048" />
</ResourceType>
```

Binding

The Binding attribute complies with the binding expression syntax or the calculation expression
syntax. So, it can use the C# language to specify a more complex binding. See the
[ Bindings ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/bindings/index.md) and [Expressions](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/expressions/index.md) topics for
additional information.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ScalarRule Property="email" Binding="C#:user:user.firstName+"."+user.lastName+"@acme.com"" />
```

IsMapped

Consider a system that we want to connect to Identity Manager, let's call it SYST, using a title
property. Consider also that SYST needs to be provisioned with the value of title, but does not
allow any other system to retrieve the said value.

In this case, we set `IsMapped` to false so that Identity Manager sends the adequate provisioning
order when needed, and then is able to change the provisioning state to **Executed** without
synchronization. See the [Provision](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/user-guide/administrate/provisioning/index.md)
[ Synchronize Data ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/user-guide/set-up/synchronization/index.md) topic for additional
information.

The following example computes users' title in a given managed system, based on Identity Manager's
`PersonalTitle` property without ever retrieving the value:

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ScalarRule Property="title" Binding="PersonalTitle" IsMapped="false" />
```

TimeOffset

A scalar rule is applied according to reference start and end dates (configured through record
sections and context rules), usually users' arrival and departure days. It means that, for a user
matching the rule's criteria, a property is to be computed, by default, from the user's arrival day
until their departure day. See the [ Record Section ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/recordsection/index.md) and
[ Context Rule ](/docs/identitymanager/saas/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/contextrule/index.md) topics for additional information.

![Schema - Default Application Period](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/datamodel_scalarrule_timeoffsetdefault.webp)

A time offset adjusts the period for which the rule applies and computes a property's value.

The following example impacts the property for the activation of nominative AD accounts:

- The first rule deactivates the account from its creation, i.e. 1 month before the user's arrival
  day, until the arrival day;
- The second rule activates the account from the user's arrival day until their departure;
- The third rule deactivates the account from the user's departure day and until its deletion, i.e.
  6 months after the departure day.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="AD_Entry_NominativeUser" Policy="Default" TargetEntityType="AD_Entry" Category="Accounts" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" ApprovalWorkflowType="None">    <ScalarRule Property="accountEnabled" Expression="C#:person:return &quot;false&quot;;" TimeOffsetReference="Before" TimeOffsetBeforeReference="-43200" TimeOffsetAfterReference="0" />    <ScalarRule Property="accountEnabled" Expression="C#:person:return person.Leave.GetValueOrDefault() ? &quot;false&quot; : &quot;true&quot;;" TimeOffsetReference="Around" TimeOffsetBeforeReference="0" TimeOffsetAfterReference="0" />    <ScalarRule Property="accountEnabled" Expression="C#:person:return &quot;false&quot;;" TimeOffsetReference="After" TimeOffsetBeforeReference="0" TimeOffsetAfterReference="259200" />    ...
</ResourceType>
```

![Schema - Offset Application Period](/img/product_docs/identitymanager/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/datamodel_scalarrule_timeoffsetexample.webp)

If the time period of property computation exceeds the limits of the period of resource type
assignment, then the period of resource type assignment is extended accordingly.

Note that the rules are applied in a specific order according to their offset reference: After,
Before, Around and Default. Each rule overwrites pre-existing values. Thus in case of overlapping
rules, Default-offset rules overwrite the values of Around-offset rules, which overwrite the values
of Before-offset rules, which overwrite the values of After-offset rules. We could have the
following:

| TimeOffsetReference default value: 0       | TimeOffsetReference | Offset mode defining which dates to use as references, in order to apply the time offset. The time period for which the rule is applied is adjusted accordingly. 0 - Default: the offset inherited from the type rule. 1 - Around: the offset before reference is applied from the start date of the resource, and the offset after reference is applied from the end date. 2 - Before: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the start date of the resource. 3 - After: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the end date of the resource. **NOTE:** in a situation with several scalar rules, the order of application is: After, then Before, then Around, then Default. Each rule is able to overwrite those previously applied in case they overlap. _Remember,_ two offsets of the same mode should never overlap. Resources' start and end dates can be configured through record sections and/or context rules. |

## Child Element: TypeRule

A resource type rule assigns resources to given users if they match specific criteria. These
resources are to be provisioned, i.e. written to the managed system.

A resource type rule is defined by the child element `<TypeRule>` of the `<ResourceType>` element.

**NOTE:** The specification of several resource type rules for one resource type implies the union
of all rules, i.e. the combination of all rules (and all sets of criteria) with an OR operator.

### Examples

With a dimension criterion

The following rule will assign an App1_Standard_Account resource (resource of type App1_Account) to
any User whose organization dimension (dimension binded to column 0) identifier is Marketing.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Policy="Default" Identifier="App1_Standard_Account" TargetEntityType="App1_Account" SourceEntityType="User">
    <TypeRule D0="Marketing">
    ...
</ResourceType>
```

With a single role criterion

In addition to dimensions, a single role can be used as a criterion for a rule.

The following rule will assign an App1_Standard_Account resource to all User whose organization
dimension identifier is Marketing and having the single role Multimedia_Designer.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Policy="Default" Identifier="App1_Standard_Account" TargetEntityType="App1_Account" SourceEntityType="User">
    <TypeRule D0="Marketing" SingleRole="Multimedia_Designer">
    ...
</ResourceType>
```

Without any criterion

Di and SingleRole conditions are not mandatory. A type rule with no condition entails the creation
of an AssignedResourceType, and hence of a target resource (from the target entity type), for every
source resource (from the source entity type). See the AssignedResourceType topic for additional
information.

The following example declares a new rule to give the resource type "AD_Entry_NominativeUser" to all
users.

Code attributes enclosed with `<>` need to be replaced with a custom value before entering the
script in the command line.

```
<ResourceType Identifier="AD_Entry_NominativeUser" Policy="Default" TargetEntityType="AD_Entry" Category="Accounts" SourceEntityType="Directory_User" Type="Suggested" ApprovalWorkflowType="None">
    <TypeRule Policy="Default" />
    ...
</ResourceType>
```

| TimeOffsetReference default value: 0       | TimeOffsetReference | Offset mode defining which dates to use as references, in order to apply the time offset. The time period for which the rule is applied is adjusted accordingly. 0 - Default: no offset. 1 - Around: the offset before reference is applied from the start date of the resource, and the offset after reference is applied from the end date. 2 - Before: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the start date of the resource. 3 - After: the offset before and after reference are both applied from the end date of the resource. In a situation with several resource type rules, the order of application is descending (After-Before-Around-Default). Thus each time offset is able to overwrite those previously applied in case they overlap. two offsets of the same mode should never overlap. Resources' start and end dates can be configured through record sections and/or context rules. |
| Type default value: 0                      | RuleType            | Represents the type of the rule. 0 - Required: the resource type is automatically assigned to users matching the criteria. 1 - Requested Automatically: the resource type is listed in the permission basket of new workers. These assignments can still be modified. For existing workers, the rule's type is Suggested. 2 - Suggested: the resource type is listed among suggested permissions in the permission basket of users matching the criteria during an entitlement request. Suggested assignments must be selected manually to be requested, and will go through the validation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
