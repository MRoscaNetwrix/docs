# Manual Provisioning

Usercube natively sends notifications concerning manual provisioning.

## Overview

### Notification Trigger

The notifications are sent after a `FulfillTask` with a connection based on the
[`Ticket/identitymanager`](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/identitymanager/integration-guide/connectors/references-packages/manual-ticket/index.md)
package.

### Notification Recipients

The notifications are sent to the users who own a profile with the following permission:
`/Custom/ProvisioningPolicy/PerformManualProvisioning/{entityType_identifier}` where
`{entityType_identifier}` is the source entity type.

In order to receive the notifications, a profile must have the full permission path. Having a
(great-)parent permission will not enable notifications for all child entities.

For example, the permission `/ProvisioningPolicy/PerformManualProvisioning/Directory_User` allows a
profile to perform manual provisioning with `Directory_User` as the source entity type, and receive
the corresponding notifications. On the contrary, the permission
`/ProvisioningPolicy/PerformManualProvisioning/` allows a profile to perform manual provisioning for
all entity types, but not receive the corresponding notifications.

The permission can be configured in an
[access control entry](/docs/identitymanager/6.1/identitymanager/integration-guide/toolkit/xml-configuration/access-control/accesscontrolrule/index.md)
so that notifications are disabled.
