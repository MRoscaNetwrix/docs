# Owner List

Access your **Owner List** from your menu bar. This is where Administrators can add or remove owners
from reviews. All changes are captured in the [UAR History](/docs/platgovnetsuite/uar/uar_history.md).

Auditors can view the Owner list and Owner notes, but cannot add or remove owners.

Here is an example of the **Owner List**:
