Honey Accounts

An additional feature is to add Honey Accounts to be monitored.

- Use the Add New Account button to enter a honey account [domain\username] in the pop-up window.
  There is no limit on the number of honey accounts to be monitored.
- The Remove Selected button will remove the selected account from the Honey Accounts monitored
  list.
- After making changes to the list, click **Save**.

Authentication activity by a honey account will generate an INTERCEPT: Honey Accounts Offense. See
the
[INTERCEPT Offenses in QRadar](/docs/threatprevention/7.4/siemdashboard/qradar/offenses.md)
topic for additional information.
