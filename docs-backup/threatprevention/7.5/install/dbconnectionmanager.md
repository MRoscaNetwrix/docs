# DB Connection Manager Wizard

The Database Connection Manager (SIDBConfigMgr.exe) allows you to update the connection options for
the NVMonitorConfig and NVMonitorData databases. The databases are originally configured during
initial install of the Enterprise Manager package. See the
[Application Server Install](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/install/application.md) topic for additional information.

_Remember,_ the host, port, and user for the NVMonitorConfig and NVMonitorData databases are
displayed on the
[Events Database Configuration Window](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/configuration/eventsdatabaseconfiguration.md). The
current Archive Database settings are located on the Archive DB tab of the Database Maintenance
window. See the [Archive Data](/docs/threatprevention/7.5/admin/configuration/databasemaintenance/archive.md) topic for
additional information.

Follow the steps to manage database settings on the DB Connection Manager Wizard.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the following location on the Threat Prevention server:

`...\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager`

**Step 2 –** Double-click **SIDBConfigMgr.exe** to launch the Netwrix Threat Prevention DB
Connection Manager wizard.

**Step 3 –** You can update the following:

- EM config file – Displays the current location of the SIEnterpriseManager.exe.config file. Use the
  ellipsis (...) to locate the configuration file if it is not available at the default location.
  The default location is:

  ...\Netwrix\Netwrix Threat Prevention\SIEnterpriseManager\SIEnterpriseManager.exe.config

The Database Connection Manager application generates a new connection string to either the
NVMonitorConfig/NVMonitorData database or the Archive database. To update either of these strings,
you must provide information in the corresponding section, SQL Connection Settings or Archive
Database Connection Settings, before clicking the Update button, which generates a new connection
string for that database.

- SQL Connection Settings:
  - Server Name – Current SQL Server
  - Port – Port number for access to the SQL Server
  - Windows Authentication – By default, SQL Server authentication is used to connect to the SQL
    Server that hosts the database. Select this checkbox to use Windows authentication instead.
  - SQL Server Account/Windows Account – This label depends on whether you select the Windows
    Authentication checkbox or not. Provide the username for the account that has the necessary
    credentials to access the SQL Server
  - Password – Password of the account
- Archive DB Connection Settings:

  - Update Archiving Connection Settings – The settings in this section will apply if this
    checkbox is selected
    - Archive Server Name – The SQL Server where the Archive database resides
    - Port – Port number for access to the Archive database
    - Archive Database – Name of the Archive database
  - Windows Authentication – By default, SQL Server authentication is used to connect to the SQL
    Server that hosts the database. Select this checkbox to use Windows authentication instead.

    On selecting this checkbox, the SQL Server Account and Password boxes get disabled.

  - SQL Server Account – Username for the account that has the necessary credentials to access the
    SQL Server
  - Password – Password of the account

**Step 4 –** The system verifies the new connection string data for the desired SQL server. The
**Ignore Errors** checkbox controls the behavior when the system encounters an error when attempting
to connect:

- Unchecked – The connection string is discarded if any errors are encountered when the Update
  button is clicked.
- Checked – All errors encountered are ignored and the connection string is updated without
  verification against the SQL Server

**Step 5 –** Click the **Update** button to re-create the connection string for the database
settings and test the new credentials against the SQL server, or click **Exit** to cancel any
changes.
