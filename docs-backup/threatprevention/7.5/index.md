# Netwrix Threat Prevention 7.5

Netwrix Threat Prevention strengthens an organization's defense against internal and external threats by acting as a real-time protective layer around critical systems, including Active Directory, Exchange, and file systems. Unlike native Windows logging, it intercepts and blocks risky activity at the source - before damage occurs.

- **Proactive Blocking** – Automatically blocks unauthorized or suspicious actions before they impact business systems
- **Real-Time Alerts and Enforcement** – Enforces custom security policies with immediate alerts and automated responses
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail** – Records rich, contextual event details with pre- and post-change values
- **Seamless Third-Party Integration** – Feeds enriched, real-time data to SIEM platforms and other tools
- **Modern, Secure Architecture** – FIPS 140-2 compliant architecture for modern security requirements
