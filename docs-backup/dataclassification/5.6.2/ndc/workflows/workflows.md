# Understanding Workflows

A workflow allows you to configure an automated action that will be performed on a document,
following a classification decision. For example:

- Send an email message to personnel in charge
- Move or copy a document from one location to another, and many others.

To set up a workflow, you need to do the following:

- Specify conditions, defining the classification decisions that this workflow will act upon.
- Configure rules that will trigger your workflow actions.

- Select actions that will take place when one or more rule conditions are met.
