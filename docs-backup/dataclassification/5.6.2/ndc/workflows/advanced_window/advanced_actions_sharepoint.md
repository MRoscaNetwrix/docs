# Advanced Actions for SharePoint

In addition to the **Email Alert** ,**Migrate Document** and additional classification, the
following actions are available for the **SharePoint** content source type:

- [Migrate Document](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/ndc/workflows/actions/workflows_migration.md)
  including copy and move operations
- Document property field (metadata) update, including:

  - **Send fixed value**, **send crawled value** — these actions apply new metadata value entered
    by user or retrieved from the related NDC database field, respectively.
  - **Send classification value** — this action writes classification metadata (**Taxonomy**) into
    the selected property field (**Field Name**). If multiple classification values are applied,
    they will be written using delimiters.
  - **Write O365 Label**, **Remove O365 Label** — use these actions to write or remove Office 365
    retention label as document metadata. These labels are typically used to automatically apply
    data protection policies to your documents.

  **NOTE:** These actions require Microsoft Office 365 retention labels to be configured. See
  [this Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/labels) for
  details.

  - **Filtered Targeted Meta Update** — this advanced action can be used to update a SharePoint
    property based on rules embedded in the taxonomy clues. Enter the document property to update
    in the **Update Field**, then select the required **Taxonomy** and enter **Match Field**, i.e.
    the field name/clue to match on.

- Apply MIP Label, Remove MIP Label — these actions, respectively, apply and remove sensitivity
  label to/from a document stored on a file system, using Microsoft Information Protection (MIP).
  This helps to automate protection policies application. See
  [Modify MIP Label](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/ndc/workflows/mip_labels/mip_workflow_action.md)
  for details.
