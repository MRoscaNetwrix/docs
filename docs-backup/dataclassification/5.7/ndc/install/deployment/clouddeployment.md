# Data Storages and Sizing

Netwrix Data Classification utilizes two data storages:

- NDC SQL database — SQL Server database that stores product configuration and metadata for the data
  sources.
- NDC Index — a full-text search index that comprises a set of files in the proprietary format
  (.CSE).

### NDC SQL database

Make sure you have NDC Server and **NDC SQL database** deployed on different machines.

It is recommended to create the NDC SQL database on a dedicated SQL Server instance.

- Minimal requirement is SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition.
- Estimate required disk space assuming _10 - 12 KB_ per indexed object. For example, for _5, 000,
  000_ objects, the database size will be approximately _50 GB_.  
  Therefore, SQL Server Express edition will be only suitable for evaluation and PoC environments
  (up to 1, 000,000 documents to process).

    **TIP:** Netwrix recommends using SSD storage for both: database and Netwrix Data Classification
    servers.

- If configuring database settings via SQL Server Management Studio, you will need to set
  **Autogrowth / Maxsize** values for the PRIMARY database files as follows:
    - **File growth**: _128 MB_ - recommended value for small to medium environment, _512 MB_ - for
      large environment, i.e. if planning to index data sources containing 16, 000, 000+ objects.
    - **Maximum File Size** - select _Unlimited_.
- Make sure that the **Recovery model** for this database is set to _Simple_. Do not change the
  recovery model — to avoid log files growth.

### NDC Index

Required disk space for the NDC Index file storage will depend, in particular, on the data
processing mode you plan to use (_No Index_, _Keyword_ or _Compound Term_).

As a rule of thumb, required space can be calculated as 35% of data you plan to be indexed. For
example, if you have 45 GB of files, they will require up to 15 GB for the NDC Index files.

## Scalability and Performance

Scalability and performance testing revealed that based on the number of objects to classify, the
environments can be ranged as follows:

| Number of objects to classify | Environment                                 | Comment                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Up to 1, 000, 000             | Proof-of-concept and small-size environment |                                                                            |
| Up to 16, 000, 000            | Mid-size environment                        |                                                                            |
| Up to 64, 000, 000            | Large-size environment                      |                                                                            |
| More than 64, 000, 000        | Extra-large environment                     | System architect's assistance is required for deployment planning requires |

Again, consider that for the large-size and extra-large environments, it is strongly recommended to
configure a cluster of several NDC Servers and apply DQS mode to these clustered servers. See
[Configuring NDC Servers Cluster and Load Balancing with DQS Mode](../../requirements/dqsmode.md)
for details.
