# Semi Private Groups

This view lists only the semi-private groups created using Directory Manager in the connected
identity store. It does not list expired or deleted semi private groups. To view the expired or
deleted groups, select the [Expired Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/directorymanager/portal/group/allexpiredgroups.md) or
[Deleted Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/directorymanager/portal/group/recyclebin/overview.md) respectively.

You can [Modify Search Directory](allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search semi private
groups and add [Filter All Groups](allgroups.md#filter-all-groups) by clicking **Private Group Grid
Filters**. All the semi private groups matching the filters will be displayed.
