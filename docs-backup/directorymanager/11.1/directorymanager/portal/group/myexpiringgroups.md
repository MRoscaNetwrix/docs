# My Expiring Groups

To view a list of your expiring groups, click **Groups** on the left navigation pane and select **My
Groups**. On the My Groups page, click the **My Expiring Groups** tab.

Groups that will expire in 30 days or less are considered as expiring groups. The expiry date is
calculated from a groupâ€™s expiry policy. The Group Life Cycle job is responsible for expiring these
groups on their respective expiry dates; however, you can also manually expire a group before it
reaches the expiry date.

By default, the tab lists the groups that you are the primary owner for. To include the groups for
which you are an additional owner, select the **Display additional group ownership in My Expiring
Groups** check box on the [Portal Settings](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/directorymanager/portal/setting/portal.md) panel.

You can [Modify Search Directory](allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search expiring groups
and add [Filter All Groups](allgroups.md#filter-all-groups)by clicking **My Expiring Group Grid
Filters**. All the expiring groups matching the filters will be displayed.
