# Access Admin Center

Admin Center is a web-based application that can be accessed over the Internet and Intranet. It
comes with a default provider,Directory Manager, which primarily facilitates first-time login to the
application. Typically, the Directory Manager provider has one default user, _Super Admin_, that has
full access to the Admin Center. On signing in, this user can create identity stores and configure
settings to get the application ready for use.

## Sign In

You must connect the Admin Center to an identity store while signing in.

Use any of the following methods to connect and sign in:

- Select an identity store and enter the username and password of your identity store account.

  NOTE: To sign in using the Directory Manager provider, enter the username and password you
  provided for the _GroupID administrator_ on the Service Account Settings page of the
  Configuration Tool. See the
  [Configure a New Directory Manager Server with a New or an Existing Database](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/directorymanager/install/configure/gidserver.md)
  topic.

- Select an identity store and sign in using a SAML provider. This option is available if a SAML
  provider is configured with the selected identity store.

  NOTE: Microsoft Entra ID MFA enabled users cannot log into Directory Manager using their
  username and password. They will be authenticated through the SAML provider configured for in
  Directory Manager.

Next, you may have to pass second factor authentication, depending on whether it is enabled for your
role in the identity store. You can perform tasks in the Admin Center in keeping with your role and
permissions in the identity store.

To Sign In

Use one of the following methods to sign in.

- Type the Admin Center URL in the address bar of a web browser and press Enter. For example:  
  https://[machine name]:4443//AdminCenter
- On the Windows Start menu, search for the Directory Manager 11.x icon and double-click it to
  launch Admin Center in a browser window.

If enabled for your role in the identity store, you must pass second factor authentication after
signing in via any of the above methods.

For second factor authentication, one of the following applies:

- If you have not enrolled your identity store account in Directory Manager, the Enroll Account page
  is displayed. You must enroll using at least one authentication type. See the
  [Enroll your Identity Store Account](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/directorymanager/admincenter/enroll.md) topic.
- If you have already enrolled your identity store account in Directory Manager, the Authenticate
  page is displayed. It lists the authentication type(s) your account is enrolled with. Select an
  authentication type to authenticate. See the
