# Image management

## What is image management?

All logos and icons are managed in the image management. They can then be linked to the
corresponding data records. The images are then displayed in the Basic view as well as in the list
view of the client.

## Relevant rights

The following options are required:

- Can upload new password images
- Can manage password images

NOTE: It is important that the setting “Ask for Favicon-Download “ is only considered, if the right
“Can upload new password images “ has been activated!

#### Managing Icons/Logos

There are two ways to upload icons.

1. By creating or saving the dataset.

In order to import favicons directly when saving the data set, the following preconditions must be
met:

- Setting “Ask Favicon-Download “ is activated.
- A URL is stored in the data record.

If these preconditions are met, the stored URL is checked for the favicon when saving the data
record. If a favicon is found, it will be imported into the database and displayed in the data
record in future.

NOTE: If there are several deposited, always use the first one.

2. Manual filing

In the main menu in [Extras](/docs/passwordsecure/9.2/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/mainmenu/extras/extras.md) you can find the image management. Here, you have the
possibility to store icons and logos manually.
