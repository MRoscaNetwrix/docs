# Cost overview module

In the Cost overview module, all billed customers are displayed. Here you can see all changes in the
number of users and options (1) for the current month (forecast) and the past months at a glance.
This view can be filtered by month (2). If you use your own billing system, you can export the
displayed or filtered values as a CSV file (3).
