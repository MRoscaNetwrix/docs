# Unix IDs Tab

The Unix IDs tab provides configuration options to translate Unix IDs (UID) to SIDs. This tab
applies to NetApp devices, Dell devices, and Nasuni Edge Appliances.

When activity is performed on an NFS resource, UIDs are returned for that activity event. Depending
on the operating system, the UID can be mapped to Active Directory accounts using the uidNumber
attribute in Active Directory. The activity agent resolves the Active Directory SID based on the UID
from the activity event.
