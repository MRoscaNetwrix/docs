# Role Management Page

The Role Management page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Users & Group. It provides
details on all available roles for Privilege Secure users. There are default roles, and custom roles
can be created.

The pane on the left side of the page displays a list of the configured roles. This pane has the
following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results.
- Blue + button — Create a new role. See the [Add Custom Role](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/add/customrole.md) for additional
  information.
- Copy icon — Clones a role and adds a new entry to the Role list
- Trashcan icon — Deletes the access policy. Icon appears when policy is hovered over. A
  confirmation window will display.

**NOTE:** The default Administrator, User, and Reviewer roles cannot be copied, deleted, or
modified. Only custom roles can be copied, deleted, or modified.

The details that display the main pane vary based on the type of role selected. See the
[Default Role Details Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/details/rolemanagementdefault.md) and the
[Custom Role Details Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.2/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/details/rolemanagementcustom.md) topics for additional information.
