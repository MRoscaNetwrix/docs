# SIEM Server Page

The SIEM Server page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Configuration > SIEM. Privilege
Secure can output events to third-party SIEM solutions for reporting, correlation, and notification.
The SIEM Servers page define the SIEM endpoint, the method of connection, and the SIEM template to
be used.

SIEM Servers define where to send the event data, how the connection should be established, and the
template to define the format/data to be sent.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the **Configuration** > **SIEM** > **SIEM Templates** page.

events out the queue and processing them. Multiple SIEM services may be used to process high volumes
of events.
