# Activities Page

The Activities page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Activities. It shows the configured
activities, which contain the actions that will run during the session such as granting admin
privileges.

Activities are for singular activities based on a specific platform whereas Activity Groups can be
used for cross platform activities such as granting local administrator access. See the
[Activity Groups Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/activitygroups.md)
topic for additional information.

It is also possible to configure an activity to automatically run any Protection Policy associated
with the resource when the session completes, instead of waiting for the scheduled sync. See the
[Add Action Window](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/window/activities/addaction.md)
topic for additional information.

The pane on the left side of the page displays a list of the configured activity. This pane has the
following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results.
- Green + button — Create a new activity. See the
  [Add Activity](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/add/activity.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Copy icon — Clones the activity and adds a new entry to the Activities list. Icon appears when
  activity is hovered over.
- Trashcan icon — Deletes the activity. Icon appears when activity is hovered over. A confirmation
  window will display.

The selected activity details display at the top of the main pane:

- Name — Displays the name of the activity
- Description — Description of the policy
- Platform — Displays the type of platform, which defines the resource: Active Directory, Microsoft
  Entra ID, Cisco, Linux, Website, and Windows
- Login Account — Controls the type of account used to log into the resource: Requester, Managed,
  Activity Token, Resource, and Vault. See the [Login Account Types](#login-account-types) topic for
  additional information.
- Activity Type — Controls the type of actions for the activity:

  - Interactive — Activity expects the requester to log on to a host desktop or CLI interface
    either directly or via the proxy
  - Interactive App Launch — Activity will launch an application on the requested resource
  - Task Automation — Activity will run an automated script requiring no user interaction

- Requester Login Format — Indicates the format that will be used to prefill the Username field for
  logging into the resource. It must exactly match the username defined on the resource. This option
  is only visible when the Login Account is set to Requester. The format options
  include: Domain\SamAcccountName, SamAccountName, UPN (User Principal Name), and Email
- Login Account Template — Template determines the format of the account created for Managed,
  Activity Token, Resource, and Vault Login Accounts. See the
  [Login Account Templates](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/activityloginaccounttemplates.md)
  topic for additional information.
- Create Account checkbox — Indicates whether an account is created at the beginning of the activity
  if it does not already exist. When the Activity starts, a check is made to determine if an account
  exists. If the account exists, the user is connected to the account on the resource. If the
  account does not exist, the account is created and a password is set. The user is then connected
  to the account on the resource. This option is only visible when the Login Account is set to
  Activity Token or Managed. It cannot be disabled for Activity Token.
- Delete After Use checkbox — Indicates whether the account will be deleted at the end of the
  activity. If an account was created to perform the activity, check this option to remove the
  account after the activity is complete. Otherwise, the account will be disabled at the end of the
  activity session. This option is only visible when the Login Account is set to Activity Token or
  Managed. It cannot be disabled for Activity Token.

  **NOTE:** A built-in administrator account cannot be deleted or disabled at the end of a
  session.

- Valut Connector — Displays the name of the assigned vault connector. This option is only visible
  when the Login Account is set to Vault. Additional fields may appear based on the selected vault.

  **NOTE:** To view the password fetched from the vault, the Allow User to View Password checkbox
  must be selected in the connection profile associated with the access policy that gives the
  requester rights to the activity. See the
  [Connection Profiles Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/connectionprofiles.md)
  topic for additional information.

- Application to Launch — Indicates the application that will be launched on the RDS server that the
  user is connected to by Privilege Secure. This option is only visible when the Activity Type is
  set to Interactive App Launch.

  - Preferred RDS Host — Displays the name of the RDS server that will launch the application
    specified in the Application to Launch field. This option is only visible when the Platform is
    set to Active Directory.

- Logon URL — Displays the primary logon page. When this field has a value, it will override the
  Logon URL defined on the Website resource. This option is only visible when the Platform is set to
  Microsoft Entra ID or Website. See the
  [Microsoft Entra ID Details Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/details/entraid.md)
  and
  [Website Details Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/details/website.md)
  topics for additional information.

If any of these settings are modified, Save and Cancel buttons are displayed. Click **Save** to
commit the modifications. Click **Cancel** to discard the modifications.

Below the activity details in the main pane are the session details, the actions that will occur
before, during, and after the session:

- Pre-Session (Grant) — List of actions that will run before the session begins. These actions may
  be paired with a corresponding Post-Session action.
- Session (Connect) — List of actions that will run during the session
- Post-Session (Remove) — List of actions that will run after the session completes. These actions
  may be paired with a corresponding Pre-Session action.

A Link icon shows actions that are linked. Deleting a linked action will delete the corresponding
action it is paired with. See the
[Add Action Window](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/window/activities/addaction.md)
topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** It is not possible to edit the Action Type. Delete the existing action and then create a
new action to get a new Action Type.

## Login Account Types

Privilege Secure supports the use of various login account types that perform different functions in
the environment. See each account type for a description.

### Requester

The Requester login account type will use the user's own account to run the activity. The user will
either log onto the resource directly or be connected to the resource via the proxy. In both cases
the user will have to enter their user name and password. This login account should be used to avoid
having a separately managed account. The user needs to have a matching account on the endpoint and
needs to know the password to login.

### Managed

The Managed login account type will used an account managed by Privilege Secure to run the activity.
Once created, a Managed account will persist to the endpoint. When a session ends or is canceled,
the password is automatically rotated. The account will not be removed afterward, but it will be
disabled when at rest. The primary use case is for instances where the user desktop experience
should persist across sessions. A Managed account can be a specific account name or based on any
variable added to the Login Account Template. The password for a managed account is available to the
user via the UI during an active session.

### Activity Token

The Activity Token login account will use a unique time-limited ephemeral account created when the
Activity is started and removed when it is completed. The account name is automatically generated
from the user’s sAMAccountName and Session ID, filled out to as many characters as configured for
the activity token. See the
[Activity Token Complexity Page](/docs/privilegesecure/4.1/privilegesecure/accessmanagement/admin/policy/page/activitytokencomplexity.md)
topic for additional information. The account name can be entirely random or based on variables or
text added to the Login Account Template. The primary use case is where the user profile should be
destroyed after each session and have the user log-in to a clean desktop every time they connect; a
common use case for remote vendors and contractors.

### Resource

The Resource login account is only available when the Platform is set to Website. It allows manually
managed user accounts on website resources to be used to log into activities. The user name is
defined in the Requester Login Format field and must exactly match the username defined on the
website resource.

### Vault

The Vault login account will use an account that is checked out of the specified vault to run the
activity. The password provided by the vault is available to the user via the UI during an active
session. When a session ends or is canceled, the password is checked into the vault.
