![Add new resource wizard page showing 1. Select Resources page](/img/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/access/reviews/resourceowners/wizard/selectresource.webp)

It contains five pages:

- 1. Select Resource — Select the resource or group to be managed by the owner
- 2. Select Owners — Select Owners from Active Directory
- 3. Description — Optionally enter a note describing the resource
- 4. Access Groups — Optionally enable Access Requests and Owner Ad Hoc changes for this resource.
     When File System or SharePoint resources will be managed through the AIC, it is necessary to
     configure access groups for those resources in the target environment. An access group
     provides one of the following access levels to a specific resource: Read, Modify, or Full
     Control.

  **NOTE:** This feature requires the Access Information Center is to be configured to commit
  changes in Active Directory. Additionally, resource based groups must be set up on the resource.
  See the
  [Commit Active Directory Changes](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access/informationcenter/admin/additionalconfig/commitchanges.md) topic
  for additional information.

See the [Add a Resource](#add-a-resource) topic for additional information.

**Step 3 –** On the Select Owners page, click **Add** to browse for an owner. Repeat this Step to

**Step 4 –** When only one owner is assigned, the owner will be the Primary by default. When
multiple owners are assigned, the first owner in the list is the Primary owner. Use the arrow
buttons to order the owners. Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to modify the list of owners.
When the owners list is complete, click **Next**.The table has several columns with information on
the owners:

- Owner Name — Name of the assigned owner
- Owner Account — sAMAccountName associated with the owner, as read from Active Directory
- Owner Title — Trustee's title as read from Active Directory
- Owner Mail — Trustee's email address as read from Active Directory
- Owner Department — Trustee's department as read from Active Directory
- Confirmed — Indicates whether or not the assigned owner has confirmed ownership of that resource.
  Tool-tips display when hovering over the icons indicating whether the resource ownership has been
  confirmed, declined, pending response, or that a confirmation has not been requested.

  changes for this resource

**Step 7 –** When File System or SharePoint resources will be managed through the AIC, it is
necessary to configure access groups for those resources in the target environment. An access group
provides one of the following access levels to a specific resource: Read, Modify, or Full Control.
If either option in Step 6 is selected for this resource, it is necessary to set a group for at
least one access level. Select the desired access level and click **Change**. The Select Group
Window opens. Select the desired group and click **OK**. The Select Group window closes and the
group appears in the table. Repeat this step for each access level desired. See the
[Select Group Window](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceowners/window/selectgroup.md)
topic for additional information.

**Step 8 –** Click **Next** to continue.
