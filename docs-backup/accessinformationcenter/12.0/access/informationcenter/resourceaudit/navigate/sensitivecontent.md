# Sensitive Content Audit Interface

The Sensitive Content Audit interface is opened by searching for a particular criteria value. See
the [Search Features](search.md) topic for additional information. It contains three panes in all
audit interfaces: Reports, Results, and Group Membership.

In order to enable the criteria match search feature, the **Store discovered sensitive data** option
must be enabled in the Access Analyzer data collector scanning the target environment. See the
relevant solution topic in the
[Netwrix Access AnalyzerÂ Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer) for
additional information on the data collection options.

The criterion being audited is identified at the top of the interface as part of the interface
breadcrumb. See the [Sensitive Content Reports](../sensitivecontent/overview.md) topic for
additional information.
