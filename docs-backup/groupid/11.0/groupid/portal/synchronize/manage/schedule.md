# Schedule a Job / Job Collection

The GroupID scheduling function enables you to set any Synchronize job or job collection to run
automatically. Create a Synchronize schedule and add Synchronize jobs and job collections as
targets. When the schedule runs, the target jobs and job collections are executed.

To create a Synchronize schedule, see the
[Synchronize Schedule](/docs/groupid/11.0/groupid/admincenter/schedule/synchronize.md)
topic.
