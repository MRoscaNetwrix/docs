Compliance Score Report:

This filter is set by the way in which you access the Detail Tab. By default, the full range of
devices and score ranges will be displayed but you can dial in a Compliance Score Range by using the
drop-down filters. Alternatively, click through on the Device Scores bar from the Policy Tab to
predefine the score range.

The score for each device is linked to the full Cloud Compliance report.
