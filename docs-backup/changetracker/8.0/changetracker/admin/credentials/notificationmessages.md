Backup types vary from full backups, to individual sections of the software i.e. Planned Changes/Events.                                                                                                                                     |

| Scheduled Query document size exceeds 16mb. Consider altering the saved query schedule or filter options to produce fewer results. [`<query name>`] | This notification message is generated when a report collated from the results of a saved query is too large. The end user will need to reconfigure their queries schedule to include less days or to include fewer event types – being more specific will produce fewer results.                                                  |
| Netwrix Change Tracker™ - Group Report Results (Scheduled compliance report run change details)                                                    | This notification message is generated when a scheduled report assigned to a Change Tracker group has completed. To receive this notification a user’s notification settings must be configured for the group, Windows 2012 R2 for example and a notification type of ‘_Group Report Ready_’.                                      |

Events will appear for all trackers which are enabled through the configuration template attached to the device – FIM, file content, registry, audit policy changes etc. |
| `<Alert Event Description>`                                                                                                                         | This notification message is generated when a value that is included in the configuration template is missing on the machine being monitored. For example: a tracked registry key is missing on a 2012 R2 Server (Tracked registry value missing: `ScreenSaveActive on HKEY_USERS`)                                                |
