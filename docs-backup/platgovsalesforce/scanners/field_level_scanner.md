# Field Level Security Scanner

The Field Level Security Scanner creates a comprehensive list of Customizations, Field APIÂ Name,
Parent Object, Package, and Salesforce Type for a selected Object.

Run the scanners before you search to ensure you have the latest data.

1. Open **Netwrix Dashboard** > **Scanner** > Field-Level Security Scanner.

4. Select one or more fields to scan. The **Customization Name** is a link to the Customization
   Record.

   **NOTE:** It is not technically possible to scan permissions on all fields in each object.

5. Selected fields are shown in a list at the bottom of the form. You can uncheck individual fields
   or all fields from the **Selected Field** list.
