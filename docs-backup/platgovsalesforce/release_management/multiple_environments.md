# Multiple Environment Deployments

Multiple Environment Deployment Tracking helps you manage changes between your Production and
Development/Testing .

With multiple environment deployment tracking, you can push, pull and access your change requests in
all your environments that have Platform Governance for Salesforce installed. This alleviates the
risk of breaking your production account. By documenting and validating the change process through
change requests, deployment records and environment comparison, multiple environment deployment
tracking enables you to access change requests in any environment where Platform Governance for
Salesforce is installed, and to deploy changes and promote code from one environment to another.

## Push/Pull Change Requests
