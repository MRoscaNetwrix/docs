  Surgical Documentation Consolidation Project

  You are tasked with performing a surgical consolidation of Netwrix documentation to improve user experience while preserving 100% of existing knowledge. This is a
   precision operation - never delete content, only reorganize and consolidate.

  Core Principles

  1. Zero Knowledge Loss: Every piece of information must be preserved somewhere in the final structure
  2. Surgical Precision: Only consolidate files that are genuinely redundant or provide poor user experience
  3. Conservative Approach: When in doubt, preserve the existing structure
  4. Content Migration: Move content to logical locations, don't create new content
  5. Link Preservation: Update all internal links after any file moves/consolidations

  Specific Consolidation Targets

  Priority 1: Empty Landing Pages (31 files)

  Target Files: All /docs/*/index.md files containing only product titles (e.g., "# Access Analyzer")

  Action: Replace with consolidated content by moving (not rewriting) the best existing content from:
  - /docs/*/product-name/overview.md
  - /docs/*/product-name/gettingstarted.md
  - /docs/*/welcome.md (e.g. StrongPoint products)
  - /docs/*/index.md
  - /docs/*/faq.md
  - /docs/*/navigating*.md
  - /docs/*/what*.md

  If none of the above are present, do a deep analysis on the docs for that product and write a short Overview of that product/its docs.

  Process:
  1. Read the empty index.md file
  2. Locate the best existing overview/getting started content in subdirectories
  3. Copy that content to create a comprehensive landing page
  4. Preserve the original detailed files - don't delete them
  5. Add clear navigation links to detailed documentation

  Template Structure (using existing content):
  # [Product Name]

  [Copy existing product description from overview.md]

  ## What [Product] Does
  [Copy key capabilities from existing overview]

  ## Getting Started
  [Copy essential steps from existing gettingstarted.md]

  ## Key Resources
  - [Installation Guide](install/)
  - [Configuration](config/)
  - [Complete Documentation](product-name/overview.md)

  Priority 2: UserCube Placeholder Files (287 files)

  Target Files: Files containing "The documentation is not yet available for this page and will be completed in the near future."

  Action: Delete only files that contain exclusively placeholder text with no actual documentation value.

  Verification Process:
  1. Search for files containing placeholder text patterns
  2. Read each file to confirm it contains ONLY placeholder content
  3. Create a list of confirmed placeholder files
  4. Remove only files that are 100% placeholder content
  5. Clean up empty directories left behind
  6. Do not touch any files that contain actual documentation mixed with placeholder text

  Priority 3: Identical "What's New" Files (15 files)

  Target Files: Files with identical community forum redirects

  Action:
  - Option A: Create a shared component/template that all products reference
  - Option B: Consolidate into main product landing pages as a "What's New" section
  - Option C: Create a single site-wide "What's New" page with product sections

  Process:
  1. Identify all identical "What's New" files
  2. Preserve the redirect functionality
  3. Choose consolidation approach based on existing site patterns
  4. Update links to point to consolidated location

  Priority 4: PolicyPak Video Documentation (513 → ~50 files)

  Target Files: Single-line video title files in /docs/policypak/policypak/video/

  Action: Consolidate into topic-based index pages

  Process:
  1. Group videos by topic/directory structure
  2. Create comprehensive index pages for each topic area
  3. Preserve all video titles - just organize them into lists within index pages
  4. Don't delete individual video files that have substantial content (>10 lines)
  5. Update navigation to point to consolidated topic pages

  Example Consolidation:
  # Application Settings Videos

  ## Password Security
  - [Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager can manage Netwrix Password Secure](passwordsecure.md)
  - [Advanced Password Policy Configuration](advanced-password.md)

  ## Internet Explorer Settings
  - [Browser Security Configuration](ie-security.md)
  - [Proxy Settings Management](ie-proxy.md)

  Implementation Guidelines

  File Operations

  - MOVE, don't rewrite: Use existing content wherever possible
  - COPY, don't cut: When consolidating, copy content to new location before removing original
  - PRESERVE structure: Maintain existing directory hierarchies where logical
  - UPDATE links: After any move, update all internal references

  Content Handling

  - Preserve technical accuracy: Don't paraphrase or rewrite technical information
  - Maintain formatting: Keep existing markdown formatting, code blocks, tables
  - Preserve metadata: Keep any frontmatter, tags, or metadata
  - Respect context: Don't move content if it would lose important context

  Quality Assurance

  - Link checking: After each consolidation, verify all internal links still work
  - Content verification: Compare before/after to ensure no information loss
  - Navigation testing: Ensure users can still find all information
  - Backup strategy: Work on branches and create checkpoints

  Verification Checklist

  Before consolidating any file, verify:
  - The target file contains redundant or poor-quality content
  - The content being moved/consolidated exists elsewhere or provides genuine value
  - All internal links pointing to the file are identified
  - The consolidation improves user experience without losing functionality
  - The new structure maintains logical information architecture

  Red Flags - Do NOT Consolidate If:

  - File contains unique technical information not found elsewhere
  - Content is referenced by external documentation or systems
  - File serves as a specific landing page for deep-linked content
  - Consolidation would break existing user workflows
  - Content has specific versioning or historical significance
  - File contains complex tables, diagrams, or structured data that would be diluted

  Post-Consolidation Tasks

  1. Update internal links: Search for and update all references to moved files
  2. Update navigation: Modify sidebar configurations if needed
  3. Test user paths: Verify common user workflows still function
  4. Document changes: Create a summary of what was consolidated for future reference

  Success Metrics

  - File count reduction: Target 40-50% reduction in files ≤20 lines
  - Zero broken links: All internal navigation must continue working
  - Improved landing pages: All products have substantial index pages
  - Enhanced discoverability: Users can find information more easily
  - Preserved knowledge: 100% of original information remains accessible

  Emergency Protocol

  If any consolidation results in:
  - Broken critical user workflows
  - Loss of important information
  - Significant user confusion

  Immediately: Revert the specific change and document the issue for review.
